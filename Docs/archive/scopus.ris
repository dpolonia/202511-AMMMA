AB  - The advancement and adoption of digital health technologies promise improved healthcare outcomes globally. However, numerous challenges hinder their widespread adoption. Existing IS research offers a plethora of works addressing these challenges, making it difficult to navigate the jungle of health IS research. Thus, we need a structured overview identifying the current knowledge state. Using a text mining approach, we analyze 484 papers from leading IS journals to synthesize health topics across digital health technologies. Our study uncovers key health topics and trends, traces their evolution over time, and identifies knowledge gaps within current IS literature. Our findings underscore the importance of emerging technologies and additional stakeholders in context-sensitive healthcare. We propose a research agenda to extend the scope of health-related IS research and suggest avenues for future exploration. We advocate for IS researchers to collaborate more closely with related fields to stay at the forefront of advancements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the context of the digital transformation of healthcare organisations, this study investigates the critical role of sustained learning, employee readiness, and supportive learning conditions to enable digital service offerings. Drawing on dynamic capabilities theory, we conceptualise and empirically test a multilevel model, exploring how sustained learning behaviour and mindset shape the Ability–Motivation–Opportunity (AMO) framework at the individual level. Furthermore, we analyse how workplace learning mediates the relationship between AMO on service outcomes at an organisational level, with sector affiliation as a moderating factor. Data were collected from 856 participants with online surveys and analysed with PLS-SEM. The results confirmed that sustained learning significantly enhances individual readiness (ability, motivation, and opportunity), which in turn positively influences digital services. Workplace learning was found to be a potent mediator, and sector affiliation significantly moderated the relationship between workforce enhancement and digital service outcomes. These findings underline the importance of embedding an employee sustained learning mindset and behaviour as an organisational capability, beyond technical implementation. The results suggest that a successful digital transformation hinges on cognitive and behavioural learning engagement, supported by supportive learning structures and context-specific strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In elective hernia surgery, the primary aim is to improve quality of life, rather than to save life. Therefore, outcome measures should emphasize domains such as pain, function, and overall satisfaction. While some principles also apply to other benign procedures, this perspective article centers on hernia repair as a paradigm for redefining surgical success. We perform hernia surgeries primarily due to quality-of-life concerns, and, consequently, it makes sense that outcome measures should emphasize quality-of-life indicators such as pain, other complaints impacting daily life, and most importantly, overall patient satisfaction with the procedure. Nonetheless, many interventional studies related to hernia disease tend to focus on tangible surgical outcomes like recurrence, infections, hospital stays, and readmissions. Therefore, we advocate for a shift in the evaluation of surgeries to prioritize more relevant patient-reported outcomes when assessing the effects of surgical procedures for benign conditions. These considerations not only apply to hernia surgery but also to other surgical interventions where the indication for surgery is based on quality-of-life issues. We urge the systematic incorporation of patient-reported outcomes into surgical practices and outcomes research to promote a more patient-centered approach, aligning surgical success with the outcomes that matter most to patients. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Stakeholder preference evaluations are increasingly emphasized in healthcare policy and health technology assessment. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are the most common method for quantifying preferences among patients, the public, and healthcare professionals. While prior reviews (1990–2017) have examined DCE trends, no comprehensive synthesis exists for studies published since 2018. This updated review (2018–2023) provides critical insights into evolving methodologies and global trends in health-related DCEs. Methods: A systematic search (2018–2023) of Medline, Embase, and Web of Science identified relevant studies. Studies were screened for inclusion and data were extracted, including details on DCE design and analysis. To enable trend comparisons, the search strategy and extraction items aligned with previous reviews. Results: Of 2663 identified papers, 1279 met the inclusion criteria, reflecting a significant rise in published DCEs over time. DCEs were conducted globally, with a remarkable increase in publications from Asia and Africa compared with previous reviews. Experimental designs and econometric models have advanced, continuing prior trends. Notably, most recent DCEs were administered online. Discussion: The rapid growth of DCE applications underscores their importance in health research. While the methodology is advancing rapidly, it is crucial that researchers provide full transparency in reporting their methods, particularly in detailing experimental designs and validity tests, which are too often overlooked. Key recommendations include improving reporting of experimental designs, applying validity tests, following good practices for presenting benefit–risk attributes, and adopting open science practices. Ensuring methodological rigor will maximize the impact and reproducibility of DCE research in health economics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The role of healthcare workers in safeguarding public health, especially during high-risk events such as a pandemic, is paramount. This research explores the impact of leisure patterns on the well-being, risk perception, anxiety, and resilience of healthcare workers in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Through a comprehensive analysis of 662 valid questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, we uncover the intricate relationship between leisure activities and the holistic well-being of healthcare professionals. The findings reveal that leisure is not merely a pastime but a vital coping mechanism within the demanding landscape of high-stress healthcare environments. Distinct leisure modes have varying influences on healthcare workers’ perceptions of environmental risks and work-related stress, challenging conventional wisdom. Our study emphasizes the significance of structured leisure engagement in enhancing the psychological resilience of healthcare professionals. It underscores the importance of recognizing individual preferences and personalizing well-being support programs, offering a fresh perspective on promoting mental and emotional wellness. The theoretical and managerial implications of our findings provide valuable insights for healthcare organizations and policymakers to design tailored support systems, resources, and leisure spaces that mitigate environmental risks, work stress, leisure disorders, and anxiety and enhance overall well-being, thereby empowering those who dedicate their lives to caring for others. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We study the problem of clinician well-being, through the lens of burnout, using an alternate source of data—a large, unstructured, publicly available dataset comprising 55,441 reviews written by clinicians on Glassdoor.com from 2012 to 2020. First, we employed topic mining and qualitative coding methods to identify contributing factors to clinician well-being and drew comparisons with electronic health records (EHR), a well-studied yet controversial factor in clinician burnout. Surprisingly, EHR-or IT-related keywords were not prominent in the clinicians’ discourse. Instead, routine operations emerged as the most frequently mentioned topic in the pros and cons sections of the reviews. Since routine operational issues are influenced by IT use, we leveraged organizational routines theory and application integration theory to propose a midrange “routines theory of employee well-being” that explains how managing organizational routines through IS can help improve clinician well-being. We tested the proposed theory using econometric models and found that integrating workflow applications significantly enhanced clinician well-being. In contrast, integrating documentation applications did not exhibit a significant impact. Interestingly, we also observed that the effects of integrating workflow and integrating documentation were more pronounced in hospitals with higher ratings of work-life balance or lower patient-to-nurse ratios, highlighting the critical role of staffing levels in driving the impact of EHR integration on clinician well-being. Overall, this is the first study to theorize and unravel the latent, intricate relationship between EHR and clinician burnout, which is moderated by organizational factors such as work-life balance policies and staffing levels. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Clinical outcome assessments (COAs) measure how patients feel or function and can be used to understand which patients experience benefits of treatment and which do not. Interpretation of COA data is influenced by how meaningful change is defined. We aimed to compare how different stakeholders define, assess, and use meaningful change for decisions that impact patients. Methods: A targeted literature review was undertaken in July 2021 using Medline, Embase, online grey literature search engines, and stakeholder organization websites. Additionally, a stakeholder survey on meaningful change was fielded between March and June 2023. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze responses and identify key themes. Results: The literature review resulted in 86 references. These revealed different approaches to define, measure and validate meaningful change. There were 248 survey responses. Many respondents felt the terminology and methods for defining meaningful change are confusing. Respondents also emphasized the importance of distinguishing within-patient and between-group change, and defining meaningfulness from the patient perspective (most patients and caregivers do not share a similar definition of meaningfulness as their healthcare professionals). Conclusion: Four key recommendations for defining, establishing, and interpreting meaningful change estimates for COAs are: (1) Be clear on the type of “meaningful change” that is discussed or needed for a COA, (2) Ensure the “patient voice” is informing meaningful change estimates/definitions, (3) Acknowledge that a meaningful change estimate for a COA may differ between populations, diseases, and disease states, and (4) Disseminate data in a way that reduces ambiguity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In response to emergent challenges, lean philosophy became one of the most common approaches implemented in healthcare operations. Although lean has been widely implemented, there is still a lack of understanding of the factors that impact value creation in healthcare. Thus, this study aims to identify the factors that impact the implementation and sustainability of lean and value creation in the healthcare ecosystem. We conducted a systematic literature review of 156 articles, and our findings are two-fold: first, we present descriptive results as an outline of the extant literature on lean in healthcare, such as areas of applications, methods, tools, and success and failure cases in different areas of healthcare. Second, we present prescriptive findings and analyse overarching themes (n = 9) representing significant barriers and enablers of the lean journey. Our study provides implications to the knowledge by offering a multi-level framework that touches staff and stakeholders (people-level), operations and technology (process-level), and organisations and leadership (resources-level). This framework illustrates the impact on value creation/destruction and the need for balanced centricity in the healthcare ecosystem. Finally, we establish a future research agenda with six overarching themes and 18 research questions for scholars and managers to explore the lean journey further. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Patients with HCC face numerous barriers to curative therapies, particularly Black patients and those impacted by adverse social determinants of health (SDOH). This study aimed to identify patient-reported barriers and facilitators to curative therapies, to inform interventions that improve equitable access to care. Methods: We conducted 2 qualitative sessions with Black participants and participants experiencing adverse SDOH with HCC referred for liver transplant (LT) or resection. We also conducted one-on-one interviews with participants from sessions that underwent LT (n=2). Human-centered design methods, including journey mapping and group ideation, were used to identify challenges and solutions at various stages in the care pathway. Data were analyzed to identify key themes and to compare the experiences of Black patients with those experiencing adverse SDOH. Results: Both groups faced significant barriers, particularly related to information overload, communication gaps with health care providers, and the complexity of navigating the LT pathway. However, Black patients reported additional challenges related to the psychological burden of the diagnosis and distrust in the health care system, while those with adverse SDOH frequently cited financial instability, lack of social support, and challenges in coordinating care between multiple health systems. Despite these differences, common facilitators included compassionate health care teams and strong personal support networks. Both groups suggested solutions such as improvements in education timing and delivery, better communication pathways, and peer support groups to improve preparedness for treatment and recovery. Conclusions: While Black patients and those with adverse SDOH experience unique barriers, common threads - such as information gaps and desire for peer support suggest shared opportunities for interventions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Quality management systems are essential in hospitals, but evidence shows a real literature gap on the sustainable implementation of quality. Purpose: This study aimed to explore and identify enablers towards sustainable quality management in hospitals. Research design and Study Sample: Interviews were conducted with 23 healthcare quality managers from 20 hospitals. Data collection and/or Analysis: Data collection and analysis were conducted simultaneously by using the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven and following the COREQ Guidelines. Thematic analysis from interview transcripts was performed in NVivo 12. Results: The results reveal two categories: (1) quality in the organisation’s DNA and (2) quality in the professional’s DNA. The first category consists of: bottom-up and top-down management, the organisation-wide integration of quality and an organisational culture shift. The second one consists of: quality awareness, understanding the added value, the encouragement and engagement, the accountability and ownership for quality. Moving towards sustainable quality management systems in hospitals requires a good interaction between a bottom-up approach and leadership to ensure continuous support from healthcare stakeholders. Conclusions: This study contributes to existing conceptual and theoretical foundations with practical insights into sustainable quality management. The findings can guide quality departments and hospital management to regain professionals’ commitment to quality and to establish a sustainable quality management system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the relationship between job autonomy and burnout among healthcare professionals, focusing on two key contextual elements that moderate this relationship: role ambiguity and workers’ age. Design/methodology/approach: Employing an integrative approach, this research combines the Job Demands-Resources model with the lifespan developmental framework. A multilevel analysis was conducted on a sample of 1,232 hospital workers, nested within 74 units, to examine the relationships between job autonomy and burnout across teams with varying levels of aggregated role ambiguity, incorporating the factor of workers’ age. Findings: The results indicate significant interaction effects between job autonomy, age and role ambiguity in relation to burnout. Job autonomy is associated with lower levels of burnout in contexts of moderate role ambiguity. In contrast, in highly uncertain contexts, job autonomy proves more beneficial for older workers, while it appears to have negative effects on younger workers. Originality/value: This study enhances our understanding of the complex dynamics between job autonomy and burnout among healthcare professionals by utilizing a multilevel approach to examine the impact of contextual role ambiguity and workers’ age. The multilevel analysis offers original insights into the role of ambiguity, while the integration of two robust theoretical frameworks (i.e. JD-R model and Lifespan framework) provides a solid foundation for contributing to the discussion. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - People make sense of osteoarthritis (OA) by drawing on information, beliefs, and knowledge. This narrative review summarises diverse qualitative and quantitative research investigating beliefs and knowledge about OA and the impact these have on behaviour and outcomes. It synthesises evidence and highlights key actions clinicians can take to support people to make sense of OA in helpful ways. Beliefs about OA inform the behaviour of those living with OA and the behaviour of clinicians caring for people with OA. Beliefs about OA often focus on joint degradation and inevitable progression. These impairment-focused fatalistic beliefs can result in reduced offer of, or engagement in, active management strategies. Alternative views focus on health as part of a dynamic ecosystem where people are healthy when they can participate in activities they value. These beliefs are associated with increased engagement in self-management and lifestyle-based interventions. Clinician actions that support people to make sense of OA ways that align with helpful behaviours and support participation in valued activities represent key opportunities to improve health and well-being. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Progress feedback, also known as measurement-based care (MBC), is the routine collection of patient-reported measures to monitor treatment progress and inform clinical decision-making. Although a key ingredient to improving mental health care, sustained use of progress feedback is poor. Integration into everyday workflow is challenging, impacted by a complex interrelated set of factors across patient, clinician, organizational, and health system levels. This study describes the development of a qualitative coding scheme for progress feedback implementation that accounts for the dynamic nature of barriers and facilitators across multiple levels of use in mental health settings. Such a coding scheme may help promote a common language for researchers and implementers to better identify barriers that need to be addressed, as well as facilitators that could be supported in different settings and contexts. Methods: Clinical staff, managers, and leaders from two Dutch, three Norwegian, and four mental health organizations in the USA participated in semi-structured interviews on how intra- and extra-organizational characteristics interact to influence the use of progress feedback in clinical practice, supervision, and program improvement. Interviews were conducted in the local language, then translated to English prior to qualitative coding. Results: A team-based consensus coding approach was used to refine an a priori expert-informed and literature-based qualitative scheme to incorporate new understandings and constructs as they emerged. First, this hermeneutic approach resulted in a multi-level coding scheme with nine superordinate categories and 30 subcategories. Second-order axial coding established contextually sensitive categories for barriers and facilitators. Conclusions: The primary outcome is an empirically derived multi-level qualitative coding scheme that can be used in progress feedback implementation research and development. It can be applied across contexts and settings, with expectations for ongoing refinement. Suggestions for future research and application in practice settings are provided. Supplementary materials include the coding scheme and a detailed playbook. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Individuals living with and beyond head and neck cancer (HNC) experience many transitions in care (TiC), as their treatment and care involve a team of multidisciplinary healthcare providers across a variety of settings. TiC can be associated with medical error, patient dissatisfaction with care, and overuse of healthcare resources. The objective of this study is to understand TiC among individuals living with and beyond HNC by mapping and characterizing the existing evidence. Methods: This scoping review identified evidence sources describing TiC among individuals living with and beyond HNC by searching five medical research databases using structured language and keywords related to the population (cancer) and concept (TiC). Titles and abstracts, and full texts were screened in duplicate for eligibility. Eligible studies were those that described or evaluated TiC among individuals with HNC, of any study design published in any language without restriction based on the date of publication. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were synthesized using thematic analysis. Results: The search identified 26,431 unique evidence sources, of which 3375 were screened in full-text, and 57 were included. Most studies were conducted in the United States between 2001 and 2024 and were retrospective cohort studies. Included evidence sources most frequently focused on the delays in the transition from diagnosis to treatment, followed by the TiC from surgery to radiation. The majority of evidence sources reported system-level outcomes followed by patient-level outcomes. Eight evidence sources described interventions to improve TiC. Conclusion: The study identified a gap in our evidence regarding transitions during active treatment and in evaluating interventions to improve TiC among individuals living with and beyond HNC. Future research should focus on bridging these gaps to improve TiC and consequently outcomes for individuals living with and beyond HNC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainability in healthcare is getting considerable research attention as systems worldwide tend to balance environmental, social, and economic factors. In this context, digital technologies have demonstrated significant potential to enhance engagement among different consumer groups across various industries. Recognizing the importance of patient engagement and its impact on patient–doctor relationships for sustainable value creation in healthcare (i.e., when creating value for all stakeholders contributes to a sustainable society), this paper aims to investigate the extent to which a technological factor stimulates and fosters the engagement of patients in their own healthcare journey and how this favors long-term benefits' generation. With the aim to identify and map the available evidence, we conduct a scoping literature review. To disclose the current state of research in the studied field, we performed a literature search with the Scopus database. A total number of 76 studies published up to October 2023 were included in our literature review. By synthesizing the existing knowledge base and highlighting the role of digital technologies in fostering sustainable value creation in healthcare through improved patient engagement, this study addresses the identified research gap. As a result, this research provides three valuable contributions: (1) theoretically, this manuscript proposes a novel framework that advances the academic understanding of the potential of digital technologies to enhance patient engagement and support sustainability practices in healthcare; (2) practically, this study offers a comprehensive guidance to managers to enable effective adoption of technologies in clinical practice; (3) finally, this work suggests strategies to promote more inclusive and sustainable healthcare destined for all practitioners and policymakers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The emergence and rapid adoption of digital health technologies (DHT) present unprecedented opportunities to democratize and reduce disparities in health care by monitoring health and disease at the point of care in all patients. However, limited access to DHT is becoming a major obstacle to realizing these goals. Access to DHT is influenced not only by well-recognized social determinants of health, but also by digital determinants of health, such as digital literacy and the need for broad access to digital infrastructure, as well as commercial and economic factors. Addressing these challenges and designing unbiased systems of care are essential to enable broad access to DHT and to benefit diverse and under-represented communities. Doing so will fill gaps in the clinical evidence base and avoid perpetuating historical biases. In this Review, we propose a personalized framework to improve access to DHT, addressing determinants of access at the individual, interpersonal, community, society, government and industry levels. We frame these issues globally, highlighting how the challenges to DHT access and potential solutions might differ between continents while also emphasizing common themes. We provide perspectives from partners across the spectrum of health care, including clinicians, clinical trialists, and experts from digital health and industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Patient satisfaction is increasingly an important concern in worldwide health policy. The purpose of this research is to identify the effect of practitioner-patient communication (PPC) and cleanliness on patient satisfaction (PS), as well as the mediating role of patient trust (PT). Methods: Data were obtained from 497 patients in public hospitals in Saudi Arabia. The data were analyzed using AMOS 25 and Structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques. Results: The results show that practitioner-patient communication and cleanliness positively impact patient satisfaction. Further, it reveals that patient trust mediates practitioner-patient communication, cleanliness, and patient satisfaction. Conclusion: The findings may benefit research and healthcare policy formulators since they examined the patients’ perspective of practitioner-patient communication, cleanliness, and satisfaction at Outpatient Departments of public hospitals. The study offers important insights for healthcare authorities to devise strategies to improve service delivery in public hospitals and ensure patient satisfaction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 lockdown, it was difficult for residency training programs to conduct on-site, hands-on training. Distance learning, as an alternative to in-person training, could serve as a viable option during this challenging period, but few studies have assessed its role. Objective: This study aims to investigate the impact of distance learning during the lockdown on residents’ self-assessed competency development and to explore the moderating effect of poor mental health on the associations. It is hypothesized that radiology residents who were trained through distance learning during the lockdown were more likely to report higher self-assessed competency compared to those who did not receive organized, formal training. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2021 among all of the radiology residents in 407 radiology residency programs across 31 provinces of China. To estimate the long-term outcomes of radiology residents’ training after the initial COVID-19 outbreak, this study measured 6 core competencies developed by the US Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education reported by radiology residents. Multiple linear regression and moderating effect analysis were conducted to examine the associations between distance learning, mental health status, and self-assessed competencies. Mental health status moderated the association between distance learning and self-assessed competency of radiology residents. Results: A total of 2381 radiology residents (29.7% of the 8,008 nationwide) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Among them, 71.4% (n=1699) received distance learning during the COVID-19 lockdown, and 73.2% (n=1742) reported mental health struggles ranging in severity from slight to extremely severe. Radiology residents who were trained through distance learning (β=0.35, 90% CI 0.24‐0.45) were more likely to report higher self-assessed competencies. This was particularly true for the competency of “interpersonal and communication skills” (β=0.55, 90% CI 0.39‐0.70). Whereas, the competency of “patient care and technical skills” (β=0.14, 90% CI 0.01‐0.26) benefited the least from distance learning. Poor mental health significantly moderated the relationship between distance learning and competency (β=−0.15, 90% CI −0.27 to −0.02). Conclusions: Distance learning, a means of promoting enabling environments during the COVID-19 lockdown, serves its purpose and helps generally improve residents’ self-assessed competencies, though different competency domains benefit unequally. The impact of mental health status calls for special attention so that distance learning can fulfill its potential. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery protocols include evidence-based interventions designed to improve patient experience, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes while reducing healthcare-related costs. This is the first update of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society guidelines for antenatal and preoperative care before cesarean delivery after the original publication in 2018. Methods: Interventions were selected based on expert consensus using the Delphi method. An updated literature search was conducted in September 2024 using the Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Targeted searches were performed by a medical librarian to identify relevant articles published since the 2018 Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society guidelines publication, which evaluated each antenatal and preoperative enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery intervention, focusing on randomized clinical trials and large observational studies (≥800 patients) to maximize search feasibility and relevance. Following a review of the evidence, a consensus was reached regarding the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation for each proposed intervention according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results: The 6 recommended enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery interventions are (1) antenatal pathway patient education for scheduled caesarean delivery (evidence low to very low, recommendation strong); (2) multidisciplinary medical and surgical staff education regarding enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery support, intervention implementation, and measurement (evidence low, recommendation strong); (3) optimization of the medical care for pregnant patients with comorbid conditions, such as anemia, obesity, hypertension, prepregnancy and gestational diabetes, smoking (tobacco, cannabis, vaping), congenital heart disease, epilepsy, autoimmune disease, and asthma (evidence moderate, recommendation strong); (4) abdominal skin preparation with chlorhexidine gluconate impregnated cloth (evening before scheduled cesarean delivery) (evidence moderate; recommendation weak); (5) the duration of preoperative fasting based on the content intake (evidence low, recommendation weak); (6) the use of a preoperative, nonparticulate carbohydrate drink (evidence low-moderate, recommendation strong). Conclusion: The first 3 recommendations are for use in the antenatal period (10–38 weeks of gestation), which allow for the optimization of patient comorbidities, whereas the remaining 3 recommendations are for preoperative interventions (skin preparation, preoperative fasting directives, and preoperative carbohydrate supplementation). Educational tools for cesarean delivery with well-designed shared decision-making focus on comorbidity management should be developed. These management tasks are viewed as routine care; however, the measurable success and impact have clinical variance. The enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery goal for patients who are undergoing a scheduled caesarean delivery is to maximize the quality of the pregnant patient's recovery and the fetal-neonatal outcome. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Teleconsultation has expanded rapidly in recent years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has become standard practice among physicians. The benefits of teleconsultation, namely, improving access to care, ensuring continuity and quality of care, increasing patient satisfaction, and reducing costs and wait times, are well documented. However, its use in nursing practice, especially in long-term care settings, remains underresearched despite its significant transformative potential, particularly in resource-limited and rural settings, where it could address major challenges such as nursing shortages and access to care. Objective: This study aimed to identify barriers to and facilitators of implementing overnight nursing teleconsultation in rural residential and long-term care centers in Quebec, Canada (centres d’hébergement et de soins de longue durée [CHSLDs]), with ≤50 beds. Methods: A 6-month pilot project was rolled out sequentially in 3 rural CHSLDs in 2 administrative regions of Quebec between July 2022 and March 2023. A total of 38 semistructured interviews were conducted with managers (n=27, 71%), nursing staff members (n=9, 24%), and resident committee presidents (n=2, 5%) between February 2023 and July 2023. Results: The study identified several barriers to the implementation of teleconsultation. The main barriers reported included union opposition (managers: 23/27, 85%), network instability (resident committee presidents: 2/2, 100%), limited technology skills (nursing staff members: 7/9, 78%), a perceived increase in workload (nursing staff members: 8/9, 89%; resident committee presidents: 2/2, 100%), and a low volume of teleconsultations (nursing staff members: 8/9, 89%). Despite the barriers, participants also identified key facilitators. These included the care setting (nursing staff members: 9/9, 100%; managers: 21/27, 78%), buy-in from senior management and managers (managers: 27/27, 100%; resident committee presidents: 2/2, 100%), collaboration between the departments (nursing staff members: 9/9, 100%), nursing staff motivation (nursing staff members: 9/9, 100%), and improvements in professional practices (nursing staff members: 8/9, 89%). Finally, the relative benefits of teleconsultation, such as enhanced mutual vision, faster assessment of clinical situations, improved resident care management quality, and greater flexibility and safety, were unanimously recognized (38/38, 100%) as contributing to its acceptability and potential for success. Conclusions: This study provides an in-depth understanding of the barriers to and facilitators of implementing overnight nursing teleconsultation in small rural CHSLDs. This constitutes a sound basis for developing tailored strategies aimed at overcoming identified barriers and optimizing facilitators. The results also provide practical guidelines for decision makers, highlighting the need to adapt implementation approaches to the unique context of each facility. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of further research to broaden our knowledge on the dissemination and scale-up of health care innovations. This includes the development of learning health systems capable of responding in an agile and effective way to the needs of rural and vulnerable populations both in Quebec and elsewhere. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explored the extent of healthcare service utilization among residents enrolled in the Negros Occidental Comprehensive Health Program (NOCHP), focusing on seven key indicators: Predisposing factors, enabling factors, perceived need, accessibility, continuity, comprehensiveness, and coordination. Anchored in Andersen and Newman’s Behavioral Model and Starfield’s Primary Care dimensions, a quantitative descriptive design was used, with data collected from 315 volunteer participants. A modified version of the Primary Care Assessment Tool guided the evaluation of the indicators. Findings revealed that predisposing factors, perceived need, continuity, comprehensiveness, and coordination were strong indicators of utilization, while accessibility and enabling factors were moderate. Significant differences in utilization were observed across age, gender, education, income, and occupation, but not by marital status. These results highlight the complex interplay of demographic and systemic factors influencing healthcare access and use. The study provides evidence-based insights to support improvements in provincial health programs and serves as a reference for policymakers, administrators, and researchers aiming to strengthen public healthcare delivery for insured populations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This investigation analyzes the incorporation of theoretical frameworks in project management within the context of hospital administration through a bibliometric evaluation of publications in the Web of Science from 2014 to 2024 using CiteSpace. An analysis of contributions by 7,020 researchers in 96 countries across 426 publications identified Jeffrey Braithwaite as one of the notable contributors, while the top institutions in this field included Harvard University and the University of London. Findings reflect an evolution in methods in project management from conventional waterfall methods to agile and mixed methods. Keyword analysis emphasized an increased focus on improving quality, implementation, and evidence-based practice, indicating a greater emphasis on leadership and evidence-based practice between 2020 and 2024 compared to systems and management themes from 2014 to 2018. Highly cited publications included JAMA and BMC Health Services Research. Conclusion: Project management in hospital contexts has immense potential for optimizing resources, improving service provision, and enhancing patient outcomes while reducing organizational costs in complex healthcare systems. Practical Implications: Findings reflect an emerging interdisciplinary framework that integrates aspects of nursing, public policy in healthcare, nursing management, and patient safety with value-based healthcare programs focusing on improving quality, efficiency, and outcomes as core objectives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study is to develop a method we call “cost mining” to unravel cost variation and identify cost drivers by modelling integrated patient pathways from primary care to the palliative care setting. This approach fills an urgent need to quantify financial strains on healthcare systems, particularly for colorectal cancer, which is the most expensive cancer in Australia, and the second most expensive cancer globally. Methods: We developed and published a customized algorithm that dynamically estimates and visualizes the mean, minimum, and total costs of care at the patient level, by aggregating activity-based healthcare system costs (e.g. DRGs) across integrated pathways. This extends traditional process mining approaches by making the resulting process maps actionable and informative and by displaying cost estimates. We demonstrate the method by constructing a unique dataset of colorectal cancer pathways in Victoria, Australia, using records of primary care, diagnosis, hospital admission and chemotherapy, medication, health system costs, and life events to create integrated colorectal cancer patient pathways from 2012 to 2020. Results: Cost mining with the algorithm enabled exploration of costly integrated pathways, i.e. drilling down in high-cost pathways to discover cost drivers, for 4246 cases covering approx. 4 million care activities. Per-patient CRC pathway costs ranged from $10,379 AUD to $41,643 AUD, and varied significantly per cancer stage such that e.g. chemotherapy costs in one cancer stage are different to the same chemotherapy regimen in a different stage. Admitted episodes were most costly, representing 93.34% or $56.6 M AUD of the total healthcare system costs covered in the sample. Conclusions: Cost mining can supplement other health economic methods by providing contextual, sequence and timing-related information depicting how patients flow through complex care pathways. This approach can also facilitate health economic studies informing decision-makers on where to target care improvement or to evaluate the consequences of new treatments or care delivery interventions. Through this study we provide an approach for hospitals and policymakers to leverage their health data infrastructure and to enable real time patient level cost mining. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Over the last 20 years, global healthcare has placed a major focus on improving the survival rates of mothers and children, recognizing the potential to prevent a significant number of deaths resulting from pregnancy and childbirth. Nevertheless, there remains an ongoing obstacle to the insufficient utilization of critical obstetric services to achieve optimal health outcomes for pregnant women. This study aimed to assess the magnitude and determinants of maternal healthcare use in the Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. Methods: Data were obtained from a household survey as part of the baseline assessment of a cluster randomized controlled trial. The study participants comprised 588 women in early pregnancy, specifically those with a gestational age of less than 20 weeks. Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with the use of maternal health services. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were used to assess the strength of the associations, with significance level set at a p-value ≤ 0.05. Results: The overall prevalence of maternal health service utilization was 87.9% (CI: 85.1, 90.4) for antenatal care, 74.7% (CI: 73.2, 79.9) for health facility delivery, and 60.4% (CI: 56.4, 64.3) for postnatal care. Multivariable logistic analysis revealed that maternal health service use was significantly influenced by access to health facilities (AOR: 6.6; 95% CI: 2.39, 18.16), financial hardship (AOR: 3; 95% CI: 1.97, 4.61), perceived respectful care (AOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.07, 5.11), perceived privacy of service provisions (AOR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.47, 4.06), and attitudes toward maternal service use (AOR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.48, 3.24). Conclusions: The study revealed slightly higher rates of antenatal care, facility delivery, and postpartum care utilization. However, there was a low proportion of early antenatal care initiation, and high rates of antenatal care dropout. Mobile phone-based messaging intervention may enhance maternal health service use by addressing factors such as lack of access, economic challenges, disrespectful care, no privacy of procedures, and unfavorable attitudes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Measures of patient experience are increasingly valued as key to healthcare quality assessment. We aimed to identify and describe publicly available measures assessing patient-reported experience of solid organ transplantation healthcare, and identify patient groups, healthcare settings, or aspects of patient experience underserved by existing measures. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to 6th July 2023; supplemented with grey literature searches. Two reviewers independently screened search hits; outputs reporting patient-reported measures of multiple aspects of established solid organ transplantation healthcare were eligible. We abstracted measure context, characteristics, content (i.e., attributes of patient experience assessed), and development and validation processes. Results: We identified nine outputs reporting eight measures of patient experience; these related only to kidney (n = 5) or liver (n = 3) transplantation, with no available measures relating to heart, lung, pancreas or intestinal transplantation. Of the identified measures, four were specific to solid organ transplant recipients. Measures sought to assess “patient satisfaction” (n = 4) and “patient experience” (n = 4) of healthcare. Measures mapped to between five and 16 of 20 attributes of patient experience, most often Information and education, Communication, and Access to care (all n = 7). Six measures reported a development process, only three reported a validation process. Conclusions: Publicly available patient-reported measures of organ transplantation healthcare experiences are limited to kidney and liver transplantation. There is heterogeneity in measure context, characteristics, and content, and insufficient clarity concerning how well measures capture the specific experiences of transplant recipients. Formalised measures of patient experience, specific to solid organ transplantation, with transparent reporting of development and validity are needed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Patient-reported outcome and experience measures (PROMs and PREMs, respectively) are evidence-based, standardized questionnaires that can be used to capture patients’ perspectives of their health and health care. While substantial investments have been made in the implementation of PROMs and PREMs, their use remains fragmented and limited in many settings. Analysis of multi-level barriers and enablers to the implementation of PROMs and PREMs has been hampered by the lack of use of state-of-the-art implementation science frameworks. This umbrella review aims to consolidate available evidence from existing quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods systematic and scoping reviews covering factors that influence the implementation of PROMs and PREMs in healthcare settings. Methods: An umbrella review of systematic and scoping reviews will be conducted following the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods reviews of studies focusing on the implementation of PROMs and/or PREMs in all healthcare settings will be considered for inclusion. Eight bibliographical databases will be searched. All review steps will be conducted by two reviewers independently. Included reviews will be appraised and data will be extracted in four steps: (1) assessing the methodological quality of reviews using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist; (2) extracting data from included reviews; (3) theory-based coding of barriers and enablers using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) 2.0; and (4) identifying the barriers and enablers best supported by reviews using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (GRADE-CERQual) approach. Findings will be presented in diagrammatic and tabular forms in a manner that aligns with the objective and scope of this umbrella review, along with a narrative summary. Discussion: This umbrella review of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods systematic and scoping reviews will inform policymakers, researchers, managers, and clinicians regarding which factors hamper or enable the adoption and sustained use of PROMs and PREMs in healthcare settings, and the level of confidence in the evidence supporting these factors. Findings will orient the selection and adaptation of implementation strategies tailored to the factors identified.

AB  - Background: This study presents guidelines for implementation distilled from the findings of a realist evaluation. The setting was local health districts in New South Wales, Australia that implemented three clinical improvement initiatives as part of a state-wide program. We focussed on implementation strategies designed to develop health professionals’ capability to deliver value-based care initiatives for multisite programs. Capability, which increases implementers’ ability to cope with unexpected scenarios is key to managing change. Methods: We used a mixed methods realist evaluation which tested and refined program theories elucidating the complex dynamic between context (C), mechanism (M) and outcome (O) to determine what works, for whom, under what circumstances. Data was drawn from program documents, a realist synthesis, informal discussions with implementation designers, and interviews with 10 key informants (out of 37 identified) from seven sites. Data analysis employed a retroductive approach to interrogate the causal factors identified as contributors to outcomes. Results: CMO statements were refined for four initial program theories: Making it Relevant– where participation in activities was increased when targeted to the needs of the staff; Investment in Quality Improvement– where engagement in capability development was enhanced when it was valued by all levels of the organisation; Turnover and Capability Loss– where the effects of staff turnover were mitigated; and Community-Wide Priority– where there was a strategy of spanning sites. From these data five guiding principles for implementers were distilled: (1) Involve all levels of the health system to effectively implement large-scale capability development, (2) Design capability development activities in a way that supports a learning culture, (3) Plan capability development activities with staff turnover in mind, (4) Increased capability should be distributed across teams to avoid bottlenecks in workflows and the risk of losing key staff, (5) Foster cross-site collaboration to focus effort, reduce variation in practice and promote greater cohesion in patient care. Conclusions: A key implementation strategy for interventions to standardise high quality practice is development of clinical capability. We illustrate how leadership support, attention to staff turnover patterns, and making activities relevant to current issues, can lead to an emergent learning culture. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Improving health and wellbeing outcomes for people experiencing chronic musculoskeletal pain requires collective efforts across multiple levels of a healthcare ecosystem. System-wide barriers to care equity must however be addressed (eg, lack of co-designed services; overuse of low value care/underuse of high value care; inadequate health workforce; inappropriate funding models; inequitable access to medicines and technologies; inadequate research and innovation). In this narrative review, utilizing a systems' thinking framework, we synthesize novel insights on chronic musculoskeletal pain research contextualized through the lens of this complex, interconnected system, the "pain care ecosystem."We examine the application of systems strengthening research to build capacity across this ecosystem to support equitable person-centred care and healthy ageing across the lifespan. This dynamic ecosystem is characterized by three interconnected levels. At its centre is the person experiencing chronic musculoskeletal pain (micro-level). This level is connected with health services and health workforce operating to co-design and deliver person-centred care (meso-level), underpinned further upstream by contemporary health and social care systems (macro-level context). We provide emerging evidence for how we, and others, are working towards building ecosystem resilience to support quality musculoskeletal pain care: at the macro-level (eg, informing musculoskeletal policy and health strategy priorities); at the meso-level (eg, service co-design across care settings; health workforce capacity); and downstream, at the micro-level (eg, person-centred care). We outline the mechanisms and methodologies utilized and explain the outcomes, insights and impact of this research, supported by real world examples extending from Australian to global settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Quality improvement has developed and spread, and today, all Swedish Regions emphasize that their strategies are based on systematic improvement. This paper aims to describe and illuminate the development of Quality Improvement (QI) in Swedish healthcare and welfare organizations by using publications in a Swedish context. Design/methodology/approach: The overview synthesis is inspired by a scoping literature review approach of relevant literature. All publications relevant to Swedish healthcare and welfare settings between 1992 until 2020 were included. Findings: In all, 213 papers, 29 books and chapters and 34 dissertations related to QI and research in Swedish healthcare and welfare context were identified. From 2011 to 2020, the publication rate increased rapidly. Six different focus areas emerged: systematic and value-creating improvement work; collaboration between organizations and healthcare providers; use of improvement methods and (theoretical) models; leadership and learning; measurements, quality registers and follow-up; and involvement and patient safety. Further QI development in Swedish healthcare and welfare points to an increased importance of collaboration between organizations and coproduction with beneficiaries for the healthcare and welfare services. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to describe and illuminate the QI development in the healthcare and welfare sector in a country. The trajectory also points to a need for coproduction to handle future challenges. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - AIMS OF THE STUDY: Health equity is a key component of quality of care and an objective for a growing number of quality improvement projects for deontological, ethical, public health and economic reasons. To monitor equity in the delivery of health services in Switzerland, there is a need to implement valid, measurable and actionable equity indicators, along with vulnerability stratifiers such as migrant status, which could lead to differences in quality of care. The aim of this study was to develop a set of healthcare equity indicators and stratifiers targeting inpatient and outpatient populations and to test their feasibility. METHODS: A scoping literature review and inputs from a national interprofessional expert taskforce provided a set of indicators and vulnerability stratifiers. The most valid and measurable indicators and stratifiers were retained using a Delphi process. They were then operationalised, and their implementation tested in three Swiss hospitals from the three language regions. RESULTS: A taskforce of 18 experts, including a patient representative, selected 11 indicators that evaluate structures, processes and outcomes, and five vulnerability stratifiers. Although most indicators and stratifiers could be implemented in all three hospitals, data availability was limited for some variables, including patient satisfaction and access to interpreters for foreign-language patients. CONCLUSIONS: The equity indicators and stratifiers identified by this two-stage process have content validity, wide patient coverage and are focused on inequities in the healthcare system that are actionable through improvement projects. Both the indicators and the project methodology could be replicated in institutions aiming for more equitable care. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a promising healthcare technology. Especially in critical, data-driven, and complex environments such as acute care, the use of AI can significantly improve treatment processes and support clinical staff. To date, AI applications in healthcare are scarce. Research remains fragmented across individual applications. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review. In this review, we map the status quo of AI research in acute care and use service-dominant logic (SDL) from service science as a framework to integrate our analysis. Using a multilayered lens, we (1) identify intended beneficiaries of AI, (2) identify relevant activities supported by AI, and (3) determine those steps of the patient journey that have been in the spotlight for AI research. Our findings suggest that researchers have focused on hospital staff members as intended beneficiaries during the first three steps of the patient journey: admission, diagnosis, and treatment. The patient's perspective, however, remains underexplored. Moreover, 96 % of the research papers we reviewed focus on AI development and proof-of-concept studies, while only 4 % employ and test AI applications in the field. We identify three priorities for future AI research in acute care and provide suitable research methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the patients’ perspectives on the use of patient- and outcome information tools in everyday care and to investigate which characteristics affect general understanding and perceived value of patient- and outcome information. Methods: This mixed-methods study included surveys and interviews on understanding, experience, decision-support, and perceived value in patients with hand and wrist conditions and chronic pain. We synthesized our quantitative and qualitative findings using a triangulation protocol and identified factors independently associated with general understanding and perceived value of patient- and outcome information using hierarchical logistic regression. Results: We included 3379 patients. The data triangulation indicated that patients understand the outcome information, they find it valuable, it supports decision-making, and it improves patient-clinician interaction. The following variables were independently associated with better general understanding: having more difficulty with questionnaires (standardized odds ratio 0.34 [95%-CI 031–0.38]), having a finger condition (0.72 [0.57–0.92]), longer follow-up (0.75 [0.61–0.91]), and undergoing surgical treatment (ref: non-surgical treatment, 1.33 [1.11–1.59]). For more general value, these were: having more difficulty with questionnaires (0.40 [0.36–0.44]), having a wrist condition (0.71 [0.54–0.92]), better hand function (1.12 [1.02–1.22]), and requiring help with questionnaires (1.65 [1.33–2.05]). Conclusion: Patients value the use of patient- and outcome information tools in daily care and find it easy to understand. The factors associated with understanding and value can be targeted to personalized and value-based healthcare. We recommend using outcome information to improve patient independence, empowerment, and involvement in decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major preventable cause of morbidity, disability, and mortality in subjects with cancer. A global appraisal of cancer-associated VTE education and awareness is not available. Objectives: To evaluate VTE-related education, awareness, and unmet needs from the perspective of people living with cancer using a quantitative and qualitative approach. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from an online-based survey covering multidimensional domains of cancer-associated VTE. Data are presented descriptively. Potential differences across participant subgroups were explored. Results: Among 2262 patients with cancer from 42 countries worldwide, 55.3% received no VTE education throughout their cancer journey, and an additional 8.2% received education at the time of VTE diagnosis only, leading to 63.5% receiving no or inappropriately delayed education. When education was delivered, only 67.8% received instructions to seek medical attention in case of VTE suspicion, and 36.9% reported scarce understanding. One-third of participants (32.4%) felt psychologically distressed when becoming aware of the potential risks and implications connected with cancer-associated VTE. Most responders (78.8%) deemed VTE awareness highly relevant, but almost half expressed concerns about the quality of education received. While overall consistent, findings in selected survey domains appeared to numerically differ across age group, ethnicity, continent of residence, educational level, metastatic status, and VTE history. Conclusion: This study involving a large and diverse population of individuals living with cancer identifies important unmet needs in VTE-related education, awareness, and support across healthcare systems globally. These findings unveil multilevel opportunities to expedite patient-centered care in cancer-associated VTE prevention and management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Information technology innovation is needed in various fields, including health. In the health sector, technological innovations can be applied to patient care, hospital management and research. Technological innovation can be applied to various hospital activities, from patient data collection to cleaning staff activities. Various innovations are needed to simplify health service activities to make services more effective and efficient. The purpose of the study was to explore the trend of technology use and innovation in health care services in hospitals by analyzing network visualization, overlay visualization, and density visualization on the topic through bibliometric analysis. Main body: In this research, bibliometric analysis was used. Records were identified through a database search at https://app.dimensions.ai/. The data obtained was then selected further by the PRISMA flow diagram. Papers were limited to publication years 2020-2023. The publication type is the article only, on the other hand, book chapters, thesis and proceeding publications are excluded. Data were analyzed using VOSviewer, and then reviewed by co-occurrence and co-authors. From the network visualization, it was identified that there were 199 items divided into 8 clusters with 9,504 links with a total link strength of 54,785. After identifying the clusters, the trends of technology use and innovation in health care services in hospitals were artificial intelligence, digital health technology, electronic health records, health information technology, smart health, telemedicine, virtual care, communication technology, electronic medical records and health care delivery. From the overlay visualization, it was indicated that the newest topics that were widely researched related to this theme were digital health service, digital transformation, digital health technology, digital tools, and telehealth service. From density visualization, it was indicated that topics that were rarely researched related to trends of technology use and innovation in healthcare services in hospitals were communication technology, healthcare organizations, and digital solutions. Conclusion: Technological developments have had a major impact on improving the quality of services in hospitals. Health professionals need to develop and improve their competencies so that they can continue to keep up with current technological developments and innovations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Owing to long-term treatment, frequent consultations, and complications, the evaluation of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) must be improved. This study explored an opportunity for improving patient experience (PE) evaluation of patients with HNC to achieve a patient-centered, integrative evaluation model based on patient needs. The study comprised four phases: (1) a systematic literature review of PE factors for patient quality of life (QoL) and establishment of PE factor categories as a framework, (2) a review of current cancer or HNC PE evaluation tools, (3) identification of potential PE evaluation items based on patient needs by conducting user research, and (4) suggestion of integrative HNC PE evaluation items through expert validation. As a result, the 39 potential items were initially identified from the literature review and user research. After conducting two survey rounds with experts, 25 items were suggested as HNC PE evaluation items. These underscore the importance of highlighting the patient’s participation, the medical staff’s comprehensive information delivery, empathy, and collaborative communication, the hospital’s support of communication channels, the medical environment for patient emotional support, the education program, and systematic patient satisfaction data management. PE evaluation items that consider the diverse perspectives of stakeholders involved in HNC treatment and factors of comprehensive PE will contribute to improving HNC patient-centered care (PCC). © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Value-based healthcare (VBHC) focusses on increasing value for patients. Hospitals aim to implement VBHC via value improvement (VI) teams for medical conditions. To determine the patient's perspective on value, collective patient participation is important in these teams. We therefore evaluated the current state of patient participation in VI teams and share lessons learned. Methods: This mixed-methods study was conducted at seven collaborating hospitals in the Netherlands. A questionnaire (the public and patient engagement evaluation tool) was tailored to the study's context, completed by VI team members (n = 147 from 76 different VI teams) and analysed with descriptive statistics. In addition, 30 semistructured interviews were held with VI team members and analysed through thematic analysis. Data were collected between February 2022 and January 2023 and were triangulated by mapping the quantitative results to the interview themes. Results: Thirty-eight of the 76 included VI teams reported using a form of patient participation. Many respondents (71%) indicated a lack of a clear strategy and goal for patient participation. Multiple VI team members believed that specific knowledge and skills are required for patients to participate in a VI team, but this led to concerns regarding the representativeness of participating patients. Furthermore, while patients indicated that they experienced some level of hierarchy, they also stated that they did not feel restricted hereby. Lastly, patients were satisfied with their participation and felt like equal VI team members (100%), but they did mention a lack of feedback from the VI team on their input. Conclusion: The results imply the lack of full implementation of patient participation within VI teams. Guidelines should be developed that provide information on how to include a representative group of patients, which methods to use, how to evaluate the impact of patient participation, and how to give feedback to participating patients. Patient and Public Contribution: Two patient advisors were part of the research team and attended the research team meetings. They were involved as research partners in all phases of the study, including drafting the protocol (e.g., drafting interview guides and selecting the measurement instrument), interpreting the results and writing this article. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Despite the increasing use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for collecting self-reported data among hospital outpatients, clinicians’ use of these data remains suboptimal. Insight into this issue and strategies to enhance the use of PROMs are critical but limited. Objective: This study aimed to examine clinicians’ use of PROM data for value-based outpatient consultations and identify efforts to enhance their use of PROMs in a Dutch university hospital. First, we aimed to investigate clinicians’ use of outpatients’ PROM data in 2023, focusing on adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Second, we aimed to develop insights into the organizational-level strategies implemented to enhance clinicians’ use of PROM data from 2020 to 2023. This included understanding the underlying rationales for these strategies and identifying strategies that appeared to be missing to address barriers or leverage facilitators. Third, we aimed to explore the key factors driving and constraining clinicians’ use of PROMs in 2023. Methods: We integrated data from 4 sources: 1-year performance data on clinicians’ use of PROMs (n=70 subdepartments), internal hospital documents from a central support team (n=56), a survey among clinicians (n=47), and interviews with individuals contributing to the organizational-level implementation of PROMs (n=20). The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework was used to analyze clinicians’ adoption, implementation, and maintenance of PROMs. Strategies were analyzed using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change taxonomy, and results were structured around the constructs of capability, opportunity, and motivation. Results: On average, around 2023, clinicians accessed PROM data for approximately 3 of 20 (14%) patients during their outpatient consultation, despite numerous strategies to improve this practice. We identified issues in adoption, implementation, and maintenance. The hospital’s strategies, shaped organically and pragmatically, were related to 27 (37%) out of 73 Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change strategies. These strategies focused on enhancing clinicians’ capability, opportunity, and motivation. We found shortcomings in the quality of execution and completeness of strategies in relation to addressing all barriers and leveraging facilitators. We identified variations in the factors influencing the use of PROMs among frequent PROM users, occasional users, and nonusers. Challenges to effective facilitation were apparent, with certain desired strategies being unfeasible or impeded. Conclusions: Enhancing clinicians’ use of PROMs has remained challenging despite various strategies aimed at improving their capability, opportunity, and motivation. The use of PROMs may require more substantial changes than initially expected, necessitating a shift in clinicians’ professional attitudes and practices. Hospitals can facilitate rather than manage clinicians’ genuine use of PROMs. They must prioritize efforts to engage clinicians with PROMs for value-based outpatient care. Specific attention to their professionalization may be warranted. Tailored strategies, designed to address within-group differences in clinicians’ needs and motivation, hold promise for future efforts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to use the Person-Centered Coordinated Care Experience Questionnaire (P3CEQ) to assess the experience of person-centered coordinated care among people with long-term conditions in the Balearic Islands, Spain. Methods: Over 1300 participants receiving treatment for chronic conditions or HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis were invited to complete the P3CEQ and a socio-demographic questionnaire, both administered electronically via the Naveta app. The P3CEQ assesses the key domains of the P3C through an 11-item questionnaire. Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 and 10 assess specifically person-centredness (PC subscale), while items 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 measure care coordination (CC subscale; question 7 includes 4 sub-questions to specifically assess care plans). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics and P3CEQ items scores. Data analysis included chi-squared test of independence, Student’s t-test and analysis of variance test. Pairwise comparisons were adjusted by Bonferroni correction. Results: The P3CEQ and a socio-demographic questionnaire were sent to 1313 individuals (651 men, 657 women, 5 ‘other gender’). A response rate of 35.34% was achieved, with 464 P3CEQ responders (223 men and 241 women). Significant differences in response rates were observed by age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, membership of patient organizations, and use of alternative medicine. Care planning was rated significantly lower than other measured domains. Women experienced less person-centered care than men (16.64 vs 17.91) and rated care coordination worse than their male counterparts (9.18 vs 10.23). There were also differences in scores between medical condition types, with cancer and inflammatory bowel disease patients rating highest for both person-centered care (21.20 and 19.13, respectively) and care coordination (10.70 vs 10.88, respectively). Patients with skin and rheumatic diseases rated lowest their experience of person-centered care. People with higher education and those employed or studying experienced better person-centeredness. Conclusion: Using the P3CEQ, we detected significant differences in the care experiences of people with chronic conditions, suggesting the need to address potential gender biases, social inequalities, and the poorer ratings observed for certain conditions in the study population. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Feedback-informed treatment (FIT) is a way of systematically monitoring and using client feedback in psychotherapeutic processes. Research shows that FIT has a positive impact on therapeutic outcomes by improving client engagement, increasing treatment effectiveness and reducing client drop-out. However, organisations often encounter barriers when implementing FIT. Methods: This study uses a narrative literature review to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing FIT in organisations. The analysis is based on 43 relevant sources obtained through a search of scientific databases. Results: 9 categories of barriers were identified, including limited resources, negative attitudes of therapists, lack of training and knowledge, privacy concerns, and technological and systemic problems. The 12 categories of facilitators include organisational support and culture, training, technological adaptability and active client involvement. Discussion: Successful FIT implementation requires multi-level support within the organisation, including a clear vision, appropriate training and support for therapists. Key challenges for therapists are motivation and integration of FIT into existing treatment process, and at the organisational level, a deliberate approach to developing a culture of feedback. For organisations that successfully implement FIT, this can be a step towards continuous improvement of therapeutic outcomes. Conclusion: There are challenges but also clear benefits to implementing FIT, especially when supported by a holistic approach, a culture of feedback and quality training. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The digital transformation has induced significant social and economic changes, impacting services of general interest, including healthcare. National healthcare systems serve as crucial pillars of social and prosperity security, necessitating adaptation in the face of digital transformation. Among healthcare institutions, hospitals play a vital role due to the nature and scope of their care services. This study presents a scenario-based investigation to explore the forthcoming changes in the healthcare environment and their potential effects on inpatient care. The study employed an iterative approach, commencing with an exploratory survey of experts to identify impact areas and descriptors. Subsequently, a two-round Delphi survey, involving a four-member stakeholder expert group, was conducted to evaluate and refine the identified parameters. A fuzzy clustering algorithm was utilized in the study to derive four different scenarios. These scenarios elucidate alternative development paths and describe the characteristics that may lead to these developments. The study’s findings offer valuable insights for formulating proactive recommendations and interventions to effectively address future developments in healthcare. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Retention of care support workers in residential aged care facilities and home-based, domiciliary aged care is a global challenge, with rapid turnover, low job satisfaction, and poorly defined career pathways. A mixed-methods systematic review of the workforce literature was conducted to understand the factors that attract and retain care staff across the aged care workforce. The search yielded 49 studies. Three studies tested education and training interventions with the aim of boosting workforce retention and the remaining 46 studies explored opinions and experiences of care workers in 20 quantitative, four mixed-methods and 22 qualitative studies. A range of factors impacted retention of aged care staff. Two broad themes emerged from the analysis: individual and organisational factors facilitating retention. Individual factors related to personal satisfaction with the role, positive relationships with other staff, families, and residents, and a cooperative workplace culture. Organisational factors included opportunities for on-the-job training and career development, appropriate wages, policies to prevent workplace injuries, and job stability. Understaffing was often cited as a factor associated with turnover, together with heavy workloads, stress, and low job satisfaction. With global concerns about the safety and quality of aged care services, this study presents the data associated with best practice for retaining aged care workers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To synthesize available evidence of factors comprising the personal, financial, and environmental mobility determinants and their association with older adults’ self-reported and performance-based mobility outcomes. Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Web of Science, AgeLine, Sociological Abstract, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases search for articles published from January 2000 to December 2021. Study Section: Using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, multiple reviewers independently screened 27,293 retrieved citations from databases, of which 422 articles underwent full-text screening, and 300 articles were extracted. Data Extraction: The 300 articles’ information, including study design, sample characteristics including sample size, mean age and sex, factors within each determinant, and their associations with mobility outcomes, were extracted. Data Synthesis: Because of the heterogeneity of the reported associations, we followed Barnett et al's study protocol and reported associations between factors and mobility outcomes by analyses rather than by article to account for multiple associations generated in 1 article. Qualitative data were synthesized using content analysis. A total of 300 articles were included with 269 quantitative, 22 qualitative, and 9 mixed-method articles representing personal (n=80), and financial (n=1), environmental (n=98), more than 1 factor (n=121). The 278 quantitative and mixed-method articles reported 1270 analyses; 596 (46.9%) were positively and 220 (17.3%) were negatively associated with mobility outcomes among older adults. Personal (65.2%), financial (64.6%), and environmental factors (62.9%) were associated with mobility outcomes, mainly in the expected direction with few exceptions in environmental factors. Conclusions: Gaps exist in understanding the effect of some environmental factors (eg, number and type of street connections) and the role of gender on older adults’ walking outcomes. We have provided a comprehensive list of factors with each determinant, allowing the creation of core outcome set for a specific context, population, or other forms of mobility, for example, driving. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Measurement-Based Care (MBC) is an evidence-based practice shown to enhance patient care. Despite being efficacious, MBC is not commonly used in practice. While barriers and facilitators of MBC implementation have been described in the literature, the type of clinicians and populations studied vary widely, even within the same practice setting. The current study aims to improve MBC implementation in adult ambulatory psychiatry by conducting focus group interviews while utilizing a novel virtual brainwriting premortem method. Methods: Semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with clinicians (n = 18) and staff (n = 7) to identify their current attitudes, facilitators, and barriers of MBC implementation in their healthcare setting. Virtual video-conferencing software was used to conduct focus groups, and based on transcribed verbatin, emergent barriers/facilitators and four themes were identified. Mixed methods approach was utilized for this study. Specifically, qualitative data was aggregated and re-coded separately by three doctoral-level coders. Quantitative analyses were conducted from a follow-up questionnaire surveying clinician attitudes and satisfaction with MBC. Results: The clinician and staff focus groups resulted in 291 and 91 unique codes, respectively. While clinicians identified a similar number of barriers (40.9%) and facilitators (44.3%), staff identified more barriers (67%) than facilitators (24.7%) for MBC. Four themes emerged from the analysis; (1) a description of current status/neutral opinion on MBC; (2) positive themes that include benefits of MBC, facilitators, enablers, or reasons on why they conduct MBC in their practice, (3) negative themes that include barriers or issues that hinder them from incorporating MBC into their practice, and (4) requests and suggestions for future MBC implementation. Both participant groups raised more negative themes highlighting critical challenges to MBC implementation than positive themes. The follow-up questionnaire regarding MBC attitudes showed the areas that clinicians emphasized the most and the least in their clinical practice. Conclusion: The virtual brainwriting premortem focus groups provided critical information on the shortcomings and strengths of MBC in adult ambulatory psychiatry. Our findings underscore implementation challenges in healthcare settings and provide insight for both research and clinical practice in mental health fields. The barriers and facilitators identified in this study can inform future training to increase sustainability and better integrate MBC with positive downstream outcomes in patient care. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) can be used by healthcare organisations to inform improvements in service delivery. However, routine collection of PROMs is difficult to achieve across an entire healthcare organisation. An understanding of the use of PROMs within an organisation can provide valuable insights on the purpose, scope and practical considerations of PROMs collection, which can inform implementation of PROMs. Methods: We used multiple research methods to assess the use of PROMs in research projects, data registries and clinical care across a healthcare organisation from January 2014 to April 2021. The methods included an audit of ethics applications approved by the organisation’s human research ethics committee and registries which the health organisation had contributed data to; a literature review of peer-reviewed journal articles reporting on research projects conducted at the organisation; and a survey of health professionals use of PROMs in research projects, data registries and clinical care. The scope of PROMs was determined by classifying PROMs as either ‘specific’ to a particular disease and/or condition, or as a ‘generic’ measure with further classification based on the health domains they measured, using the World Health Organization International Classification Framework. Practical considerations included mode and timing of PROMs administration. Data were described using frequency and proportion. Results: PROMs were used by 22% of research projects (n = 144/666), 68% of data registries (n = 13/19), and 76% of clinical specialties in their clinical care (n = 16/21). Disease specific PROMs were most commonly used: 83% of research projects (n = 130/144), 69% of clinical registries (n = 9/13), and 75% of clinical specialties (n = 12/16). Greater than 80% of research projects, clinical registries and clinical specialties measured health domains relating to both body impairments and participation in daily life activities. The most commonly used generic PROM was the EQ-5D (research projects n = 56/144, 39%; data registries n = 5/13, 38%; clinical specialties n = 4/16, 25%). PROMs used in clinical care were mostly paper-based (n = 47/55, 85%). Conclusions: We have elicited information on the use of PROMs to inform a health organisation wide implementation strategy. Future work will determine clinician and patient acceptability of the EQ-5D, and co-design a system for the collection of PROMs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Hospitals have identified IT as a suitable mean to cope with various challenges. However, the heterogenous progress regarding digitalization cannot solely be attributed to a lack of investment. Potentially underlying socio-technical causes should be further investigated. The aim of this work is to identify factors that affect the human acceptance of digitalization in hospitals. The goal is to validate practical relevance with affected professional stakeholders as well as quantify the magnitude of the impact. Methods: The Mixed-Methods (MM) approach according to the APA Mixed Methods Article Reporting Standard (MMARS) was based on a structured literature analysis (PRISMA-ScR), expert interviews (COREQ), and a web-based survey (CHERRIES). The survey queries acceptance factors related to digitalization in hospitals. By means of a statistical analysis, correlations with the dependent variable acceptance, effect sizes and variances are investigated. Results: A total of N = 258 hospital professionals participated in the survey, with n = 155 (60.1%) female respondents, and a large share (n = 106, 41.1%) of participants from the field of nursing. Six of the 22 queried factors show a significant impact on acceptance (P <.05). The predictors competence and perceived benefit seem to exert the greatest influence. A multiple linear regression with R 2 =.68 (corrected R 2 =.63) shows a high goodness of fit. The predictors thus statistically influence the criterion acceptance (F<inf>22, 193</inf> = 13.32, p <.001). Conclusions: The factors contributing to human acceptance of digitalization-related change processes in hospitals were divided into subject-, object- and context-related aspects. The factors skill, education, affinity for digitalization, future of the workplace, participation as well as the perceived benefit were identified as significant influence factors on acceptance of digitalization in hospitals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Optimal growth and development in childhood and adolescence is crucial for lifelong health and well-being1–6. Here we used data from 2,325 population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight from 71 million participants, to report the height and body-mass index (BMI) of children and adolescents aged 5–19 years on the basis of rural and urban place of residence in 200 countries and territories from 1990 to 2020. In 1990, children and adolescents residing in cities were taller than their rural counterparts in all but a few high-income countries. By 2020, the urban height advantage became smaller in most countries, and in many high-income western countries it reversed into a small urban-based disadvantage. The exception was for boys in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in some countries in Oceania, south Asia and the region of central Asia, Middle East and north Africa. In these countries, successive cohorts of boys from rural places either did not gain height or possibly became shorter, and hence fell further behind their urban peers. The difference between the age-standardized mean BMI of children in urban and rural areas was <1.1 kg m–2 in the vast majority of countries. Within this small range, BMI increased slightly more in cities than in rural areas, except in south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and some countries in central and eastern Europe. Our results show that in much of the world, the growth and developmental advantages of living in cities have diminished in the twenty-first century, whereas in much of sub-Saharan Africa they have amplified. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Technological innovation has become an integral aspect of our daily life, such as wearable and information technology, virtual reality and the Internet of Things which have contributed to transforming healthcare business and operations. Patients will now have a broader range and more mindful healthcare choices and experience a new era of healthcare with a patient-centric culture. Digital transformation determines personal and institutional health care. This paper aims to analyse the changes taking place in the field of healthcare due to digital transformation. For this purpose, a systematic bibliographic review is performed, utilising Scopus, Science Direct and PubMed databases from 2008 to 2021. Our methodology is based on the approach by Wester and Watson, which classify the related articles based on a concept-centric method and an ad hoc classification system which identify the categories used to describe areas of literature. The search was made during August 2022 and identified 5847 papers, of which 321 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for further process. Finally, by removing and adding additional studies, we ended with 287 articles grouped into five themes: information technology in health, the educational impact of e-health, the acceptance of e-health, telemedicine and security issues. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims and objectives: Gaining insight in how people living with chronic conditions experience primary healthcare within their informal network. Background: The primary healthcare system is challenged by the increasing number of people living with chronic conditions. To strengthen chronic care management, literature and policy plans point to a person-centred approach of care (PCC). A first step to identify an appropriate strategy to implement PCC is to gain more insight into the care experiences of these people and their informal caregivers. Design: A phenomenological-hermeneutical philosophy is used. The study is in line with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research Guidelines (COREQ). Method: In-depth, semi-structured interviews with people living with chronic conditions and informal caregiver dyads (PCDs) (n = 16; 32 individuals) were conducted. An open-ended interview guide was used to elaborate on the PCDs' experiences regarding primary care. A purposive, maximal variation sampling was applied to recruit the participants. Results: Based on sixteen PCDs' reflections, ten themes were identified presenting their experiences with primary care and described quality care as listening and giving attention to what people with chronic conditions want, to what they strive for, and above all to promote their autonomy in a context wherein they are supported by a team of formal caregivers, family and friends. Conclusion: To meet the PCDs' needs, self-management should be addressed in an interprofessional environment in which the PCD is an important partner. The findings may facilitate a shift to encourage PCDs in their strengths by enabling them to share their personal goals and by working towards meaningful activities in team collaboration. Relevance to clinical practice: Three strategies—self-management support, goal-oriented care, and interprofessional collaboration—have been suggested to improve the PCDs' primary care experiences. These strategies could guide nursing practice in using more and improve high-quality nursing care. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The field of rehabilitation has seen a recent rise in technologies to support shared decision-making (SDM). Usability testing during the design process of SDM technologies is needed to optimize adoption and realize potential benefits. There is variability in how usability is defined and measured. Given the complexity of usability, a thorough examination of the methodologies used to measure usability to develop the SDM technologies used in rehabilitation care is needed. Objective: This scoping review aims to answer the following research questions: which methods and measures have been used to produce knowledge about the usability of rehabilitation technologies aimed at supporting SDM at the different phases of development and implementation? Which parameters of usability have been measured and reported? Methods: This review followed the Arksey and O’Malley framework. An electronic search was performed in the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases from January 2005 up to November 2020. In total, 2 independent reviewers screened all retrieved titles, abstracts, and full texts according to the inclusion criteria and extracted the data. The International Organization for Standardization framework was used to define the scope of usability (effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction). The characteristics of the studies were outlined in a descriptive summary. Findings were categorized based on usability parameters, technology interventions, and measures of usability. Results: A total of 38 articles were included. The most common SDM technologies were web-based aids (15/33, 46%). The usability of SDM technologies was assessed during development, preimplementation, or implementation, using 14 different methods. The most frequent methods were questionnaires (24/38, 63%) and semistructured interviews (16/38, 42%). Satisfaction (27/38, 71%) was the most common usability parameter mapped to types of SDM technologies and usability evaluation methods. User-centered design (9/15, 60%) was the most frequently used technology design framework. Conclusions: The results from this scoping review highlight the importance and the complexity of usability evaluation. Although various methods and measures were shown to be used to evaluate the usability of technologies to support SDM in rehabilitation, very few evaluations used in the included studies were found to adequately span the selected usability domains. This review identified gaps in usability evaluation, as most studies (24/38, 63%) relied solely on questionnaires rather than multiple methods, and most questionnaires simply focused on the usability parameter of satisfaction. The consideration of end users (such as patients and clinicians) is of particular importance for the development of technologies to support SDM, as the process of SDM itself aims to improve patient-centered care and integrate both patient and clinician voices into their rehabilitation care. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: A core set of requirements for designing AI-based Health Recommender Systems (HRS) is a thorough understanding of human factors in a decision-making process. Patient preferences regarding treatment outcomes can be one important human factor. For orthopaedic medicine, limited communication may occur between a patient and a provider during the short duration of a clinical visit, limiting the opportunity for the patient to express treatment outcome preferences (TOP). This may occur despite patient preferences having a significant impact on achieving patient satisfaction, shared decision making and treatment success. Inclusion of patient preferences during patient intake and/or during the early phases of patient contact and information gathering can lead to better treatment recommendations. Aim: We aim to explore patient treatment outcome preferences as significant human factors in treatment decision making in orthopedics. The goal of this research is to design, build, and test an app that collects baseline TOPs across orthopaedic outcomes and reports this information to providers during a clinical visit. This data may also be used to inform the design of HRSs for orthopaedic treatment decision making. Methods: We created a mobile app to collect TOPs using a direct weighting (DW) technique. We used a mixed methods approach to pilot test the app with 23 first-time orthopaedic visit patients presenting with joint pain and/or function deficiency by presenting the app for utilization and conducting qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys post utilization. Results: The study validated five core TOP domains, with most users dividing their 100-point DW allocation across 1–3 domains. The tool received moderate to high usability scores. Thematic analysis of patient interviews provides insights into TOPs that are important to patients, how they can be communicated effectively, and incorporated into a clinical visit with meaningful patient-provider communication that leads to shared decision making. Conclusion: Patient TOPs may be important human factors to consider in determining treatment options that may be helpful for automating patient treatment recommendations. We conclude that inclusion of patient TOPs to inform the design of HRSs results in creating more robust patient treatment profiles in the EHR thus enhancing opportunities for treatment recommendations and future AI applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: We explored priorities and perspectives on health policy and payer strategies for improving HPV vaccination rates in safety-net settings in the United States. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with policy and payer representatives in the greater Los Angeles region and state of New Jersey between December 2020 and January 2022. Practice Change Model domains guided data collection, thematic analysis, and interpretation. Results: Five themes emerged from interviews with 11 policy and 8 payer participants, including: (1) payer representatives not prioritizing HPV vaccination specifically in incentive-driven clinic metrics; (2) policy representatives noting region-specific HPV vaccine policy options; (3) inconsistent motivation across policy/payer groups to improve HPV vaccination; (4) targeting of HPV vaccination in quality improvement initiatives suggested across policy/payer groups; and (5) COVID-19 pandemic viewed as both barrier and opportunity for HPV vaccination improvement across policy/payer groups. Discussion: Our findings indicate opportunities for incorporating policy and payer perspectives into HPV vaccine improvement processes. We identified a need to translate effective policy and payer strategies, such as pay-for-performance programs, to improve HPV vaccination within safety-net settings. COVID-19 vaccination strategies and community efforts create potential policy windows for expanding HPV vaccine awareness and access. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMs) are essential to clinical practice and research. The growth of eHealth technologies has provided unprecedented opportunities to collect information systematically through ePROMs. Although they are widely used in scientific research, more evidence is needed to determine their use and implementation in daily clinical practice. For example, when diagnosed, patients with lung cancer are at an advanced stage of the disease. This entails tremendous burden because of high mortality and losses in the different dimensions of the human being. In this case, monitoring symptoms and other outcomes help improve the patient’s quality of life. Objective: ePROMs offered unprecedented opportunities to collect information systematically. Our goal was to demonstrate that ePROMs are more useful in controlling patient symptoms, lung cancer, and overall survival than their alternatives, such as nonelectronic PROMs. Methods: This exploratory review considered articles published between 2017 and 2022 identified through searches of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We found 5097 articles; after removing the duplicates, we reduced them to 3315. After reading the summary, we were left with 56. Finally, after applying the exclusion criteria, we reviewed 12. The 5-step framework by Arksey and O’Malley was used to refine the initial search results with the following research questions: Do ePROMs help physician-patient communication? To what extent do they improve decision-making? Are institutions and their digitization policies barriers to or facilitators of this process? and What else is needed for routine implementation? Results: This review included 12 articles. We found that ePROMs are an integrative and facilitative communication tool, highlighting their importance in the relationship between palliative care and medical oncology. ePROMs help assess patient symptoms and functionality more accurately and facilitate clinical decision-making. In addition, it allows for more precise predictions of overall patient survival and the adverse effects of their treatments. The main institutional obstacles are the initial investment, which can be costly, and the data protection policy. However, enablers included better funding through the development of telemedicine, support from institutional leaders to overcome resistance to change, and transparent policies to ensure the safe and secure use of ePROMs. Conclusions: Routine collection of remote ePROMs is an effective and valuable strategy for providing real-time clinical feedback. In addition, it provides satisfaction to patients and professionals. Optimizing ePROMs in patients with lung cancer leads to a more accurate view of health outcomes and ensures quality patient follow-up. It also allows us to stratify patients based on their morbidity, creating specific follow-ups for their needs. However, data privacy and security are concerns when using ePROMs to ensure compliance with local entities. At least four barriers were identified: cost, complex programming within health systems, safety, and social and health literacy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Cancer patients and their caregivers have substantial unmet needs, that negatively impact the clinical outcome and quality of life. However, interventions aimed to address such needs are still suboptimal, failing to answer the recent healthcare call for the adoption of value-based models of care. In the case of incurable oncologic and hematologic cancers, a value-based model of care should plan advanced care on patients' needs and include the quality of death as an outcome. The integration of early palliative care into standard oncologic care for patients with advanced cancers represents a recent innovative model of assistance whose benefits for patients and caregivers are now widely recognized. The key elements underlying the reasons behind these benefits are the multidisciplinary collaboration (teamwork), an honest and empathetic communication between the early palliative care team, the patient, and the caregiver (rapport building), and the ability to detect changes in the physical/psychosocial wellbeing of the patient, along the whole disease trajectory (constant monitoring). Methods: This community case study documents the quantitative and qualitative results of a long term clinical and research experience in delivering early palliative care service to address both solid and blood cancer patients' and their primary caregivers' needs. Results: Data showed decreased use of chemotherapy, blood transfusions and referral to intensive care units near the end of life; increased life expectancy; improved symptom burden and mood; increased frequency of goals-of-care and advanced care planning conversations. Hope perception among bereaved caregivers was associated with resilience and realistic expectations raising from honest communication with the early palliative care team and appreciation toward the model. Patients and caregivers perceived the possibility of a good death as realistic and not as an unlikely event as it was for patients and caregivers on standard oncologic care only. Gratitude expressions toward the model and the team were frequently identified in their reports and positively associated with communication and spirituality. Conclusions: These findings are discussed in the context of an updated literature review regarding value-based care and suggest that early palliative care integrated into standard oncology care may be considered as an effective model of value-based care. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The ongoing digital transformation ushers unprecedented challenges for publicly owned healthcare organizations. Collaborative governance models, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), advance their readiness to address such challenges, paving the way for the establishment of a viable service ecosystem. However, little is known about how PPPs enhance the publicly owned healthcare organizations’ ability to thrive amidst the digital transformation. The article investigates this issue, drawing on the exploratory case of “Lab@AOR”, a PPP established between Loccioni and the University Hospital of Marche (Italy) which focused on the robotization of a critical component of healthcare services’ delivery. Three ingredients have been found to nurture the PPP’s cohesiveness and success: (1) the alignment between the public partner’s needs and the private partner’s competences, (2) knowledge contamination, and (3) the adoption of patient-centeredness as the inspiring principle of the collaboration. The PPP represents an initial step of the transition towards a service ecosystem, entailing a fully-fledged partners’ integration for value co-generation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Older people receive care from multiple providers which often results in a lack of coordination. The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enabled value-based methodology for integrated care (ValueCare) project aims to develop and implement efficient outcome-based, integrated health and social care for older people with multimorbidity, and/or frailty, and/or mild to moderate cognitive impairment in seven sites (Athens, Greece; Coimbra, Portugal; Cork/Kerry, Ireland; Rijeka, Croatia; Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Treviso, Italy; and Valencia, Spain). We will evaluate the implementation and the outcomes of the ValueCare approach. This paper presents the study protocol of the ValueCare project; a protocol for a pre-post controlled study in seven large-scale sites in Europe over the period between 2021 and 2023. Methods: A pre-post controlled study design including three time points (baseline, post-intervention after 12 months, and follow-up after 18 months) and two groups (intervention and control group) will be utilised. In each site, (net) 240 older people (120 in the intervention group and 120 in the control group), 50–70 informal caregivers (e.g. relatives, friends), and 30–40 health and social care practitioners will be invited to participate and provide informed consent. Self-reported outcomes will be measured in multiple domains; for older people: health, wellbeing, quality of life, lifestyle behaviour, and health and social care use; for informal caregivers and health and social care practitioners: wellbeing, perceived burden and (job) satisfaction. In addition, implementation outcomes will be measured in terms of acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, and costs. To evaluate differences in outcomes between the intervention and control group (multilevel) logistic and linear regression analyses will be used. Qualitative analysis will be performed on the focus group data. Discussion: This study will provide new insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of a value-based methodology for integrated care supported by ICT for older people, their informal caregivers, and health and social care practitioners in seven different European settings. Trial registration: ISRCTN registry number is 25089186. Date of trial registration is 16/11/2021. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Increasing innovation readiness of healthcare organizations is necessary to meet upcoming challenges, including population aging, staff shortages and reduced funding. Health care organizations differ in the extent to which they are innovation ready. This review aims to clarify the concept of innovation readiness and identify which factors contribute to innovation readiness in health care organizations. Methods: A scoping review was conducted based on the framework from Arksey and O’Malley. PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched for studies that (a) aimed to contribute to scientific knowledge about innovation readiness of health care organizations, (b) were peer-reviewed, (c) reported empirical data and (d) were written in English, Dutch or German. Factors researched in the included studies were bundled into 4 overarching main factors and 10 sub-factors. Results: Of the 6,208 studies identified, 44 were included. The majority (n = 36) of the studies had been conducted since 2011 and almost half of the studies (n = 19) were performed in hospitals. Of the 44 studies, 21 researched factors contributing to innovation readiness in the implementation stage of the innovation process. The authors used a variety of words and descriptions addressing innovation readiness, with hardly any theoretical frameworks for innovation readiness presented. Four main factors and 10 sub-factors contributing to the innovation readiness of health care organizations were summarized: strategic course for innovation, climate for innovation, leadership for innovation and commitment to innovation. Climate for innovation (n = 16) was studied the most and individual commitment to innovation (n = 6) was the least studied. Conclusion: Our study identified four main factors contributing to the innovation readiness of health care organizations. Research into innovation readiness of health care organizations is a rather new field. Future research could be directed towards defining the concept of innovation readiness and the development of a framework for innovation readiness. More understanding of the interplay of factors contributing to innovation readiness in all stages of the innovation process and in diverse health care settings can support health care managers to structurally embed innovation. This review contributes to the first stage of theory building on factors contributing to innovation readiness of health care organizations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - To understand whether companies can lock in the benefits of digital technology (DT) usage during the COVID-19 pandemic, we draw on a dynamic capability view to examine how digitalization capabilities generate impacts on firm performance. Through the analysis of 165 Chinese manufacturing companies, we find that market capitalizing agility and operational adjustment agility fully mediate the relationship between digitalization capabilities and firm performance. More interestingly, of the effect size of different mediation paths, market capitalizing agility has the strongest effect. We contribute to the existing information systems literature by revealing the possible mediational mechanisms that can solve the digital dilemma. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Shortage or low-quality antenatal care is a complex and “wicked” problem relying heavily on contextual, socio-cultural, environmental and intersectional aspects. We report the outcome of an expert consultation discussing solutions to improve antenatal care quality, access and delivery in low- and middle-income countries, and providing recommendations for implementation. Methods: The social ecological model was used as an analytical lens to map and interpret discussion points and proposed solutions. In addition, a conceptual framework for maternal and neonatal health innovation based on the building blocks of the World Health Organization health system and the Tanahashi Health Systems Performance Model provided a logical overview of discussed solutions. Results: Many barriers and norms continue to hinder antenatal care access. From values, beliefs, traditions, customs and norms, to poor resource allocation, there is a need of reshaping health systems in order to provide high quality, respectful maternal and childcare. The burden of poor maternal health, morbidity and mortality is concentrated among populations who are vulnerable due to gender and other types of discrimination, have financial constraints and are affected by humanitarian crises. Conclusions: In order to address maternal health issues, good quality and evidence-based services should be guaranteed. Investments in strengthening health systems, including data and surveillance systems and skilled health workforce, should be considered an essential step towards improving maternal health services. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Accumulated electronic data from a wide variety of clinical settings has been processed using a range of informatics methods to determine the sequence of care activities experienced by patients. The “as is” or “de facto” care pathways derived can be analysed together with other data to yield clinical and operational information. It seems likely that the needs of both health systems and patients will lead to increasing application of such analyses. A comprehensive review of the literature is presented, with a focus on the study context, types of analysis undertaken, and the utility of the information gained. Methods: A systematic review was conducted of literature abstracting sequential patient care activities (“de facto” care pathways) from care records. Broad coverage was achieved by initial screening of a Scopus search term, followed by screening of citations (forward snowball) and references (backwards snowball). Previous reviews of related topics were also considered. Studies were initially classified according to the perspective captured in the derived pathways. Concept matrices were then derived, classifying studies according to additional data used and subsequent analysis undertaken, with regard for the clinical domain examined and the knowledge gleaned. Results: 254 publications were identified. The majority (n = 217) of these studies derived care pathways from data of an administrative/clinical type. 80% (n = 173) applied further analytical techniques, while 60% (n = 131) combined care pathways with enhancing data to gain insight into care processes. Discussion: Classification of the objectives, analyses and complementary data used in data-driven care pathway mapping illustrates areas of greater and lesser focus in the literature. The increasing tendency for these methods to find practical application in service redesign is explored across the variety of contexts and research questions identified. A limitation of our approach is that the topic is broad, limiting discussion of methodological issues. Conclusion: This review indicates that methods utilising data-driven determination of de facto patient care pathways can provide empirical information relevant to healthcare planning, management, and practice. It is clear that despite the number of publications found the topic reviewed is still in its infancy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective A prerequisite for patient-centredness in healthcare organisations is offering patients access to adequate health information, which fits their needs. A personalised digital care pathway (PDCP) is a tool that facilitates the provision of tailored and timely information. Despite its potential, barriers influence the implementation of digital tools in healthcare organisations. Therefore, we investigated the perceived barriers and facilitators for implementation of the PDCP among stakeholders. Design A qualitative study was conducted to acquire insight into perceptions of the stakeholders involved in the implementation of a digital care pathway in three diverse patient groups. Setting This study is part of the PDCP research project in a large academic hospital in the Netherlands. Participants Purposive sampling was used to recruit internal stakeholders (eg, healthcare professionals, employees of the supporting departments) and external stakeholders (eg, employees of the external PDCP supplier). In addition, existing semistructured interviews with patients involved in pilot implementation (n=24) were used to verify the findings. Results We conducted 25 semistructured interviews using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Content analyses yielded four themes: (1) stakeholders' perceptions of the PDCP (eg, perceived usefulness); (2) characteristics of the individuals involved and the implementation process (eg, individuals express resistance to change); (3) organisational readiness (eg, lack of resources); and (4) collaboration within the organisation (eg, mutual communication, multidisciplinary codesign). The main barriers mentioned by patients were duration of first activation and necessity for up-to-date content. In addition, the most facilitating factor for patients was user-friendliness. Conclusion Our findings emphasise the importance of gaining insights into the various perspectives of stakeholder groups, including patients, regarding the implementation of the PDCP. The perceived barriers and facilitators can be used to improve the PDCP implementation plan and tailor the development and improvement of other digital patient communication tools. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder impacting physical, cognitive, and psychosocial health. The disease course, severity, and presence of symptoms differ within and between persons over time and are unpredictable. Given the preference-sensitive nature of many key decisions to be made, and the increasing numbers of disease-modifying therapies, shared decision-making (SDM) with patients seems to be key in offering optimum care and outcomes for people suffering from MS. In this paper, we describe our perspective on how to achieve SDM in patients with MS, following key SDM-elements from established SDM-frameworks. As for deliberation in the clinical encounter, SDM communication training of professionals and feedback on their current performance are key aspects, as well as encouraging patients to participate. Concerning information for patients, it is important to provide balanced, evidence-based information about the benefits and the harms of different treatment options, including the option of surveillance only. At the same time, attention is needed for the optimal dosage of that information, given the symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and fatigue among MS-patients, and the uncertainties they have to cope with. Finally, for broader communication, a system is required that assures patient preferences are actually implemented by multidisciplinary MS-teams. As SDM is also being implemented in many countries within the context of value-based health care, we consider the systematic use of outcome information, such as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and Patient Decision Aids, as an opportunity to achieve SDM. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The focus of lean has increasingly moved from a tools-based to a systems-based approach with particular emphasis on people. However, a conceptual framework for this is lacking. The people value stream concept provides a starting point for further discussion, research and practical application in this area. Design/methodology/approach: In this conceptual paper, the author draws on their extensive experience with lean through 30 years of researching, leading and consulting in lean transformations. Findings: The people value stream concept is presented together with a series of theoretical, practical and social implications for its application. These include: a rethinking of the role of executives in lean organisations; the importance of people and their experience of work; how the issue of wasted human potential might be addressed; how lean can further evolve; how, in addition to products, people can be made the focus in lean; and how pull and flow can be applied to the people value stream, including what competencies, learning and development, behaviours, accountability, social support and mental and physical wellbeing, are required or should be provided to employees throughout their careers. Originality/value: This paper widens the existing discussion of people within lean. To the best of the author’s knowledge, for the first time in an academic paper, it discusses this within a lean context by proposing a conceptual people value stream model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background The prevention and treatment of chronic pain problems in breast cancer follow-up care require an adequate response from healthcare providers. Generally, this involves the uptake of evidence-based principles regarding pain management in everyday practice. However, despite the extensive literature on effective pain interventions, systematic and coordinated follow-up care is lacking for breast cancer survivors with pain problems in Flanders, Belgium. Objective This study aimed to gather insight into healthcare providers’ perceptions of pain prevention and treatment in breast cancer follow-up care, particularly with attention to the multilevel influences on pain follow-up. Methods We conducted four online focus groups with twenty-two healthcare providers from different disciplines such as oncologists, pharmacists, nurses, physiotherapists, and psychologists. Data analysis was guided by the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven. This guide is inspired by the constant comparison method, based on Grounded Theory. Results The identified influencing factors were thematically grouped into four levels: at the level of the individual healthcare provider, in interaction with the patient, in interaction with colleagues, and at the context level. At each level, we distinguished factors related to healthcare providers’ perceptions such as awareness, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, experiences, and intentions. For example, because of a lack of knowledge and certain beliefs among healthcare providers, referral to other disciplines often does not happen in the context of pain. Conclusion This study points out the need to explore the prevention and treatment of chronic pain after breast cancer from a multidimensional point of view. This involves not only the characteristics of individual healthcare providers but is also inherently interactional and system-like in nature. This analysis provides opportunities for the development of interventions that target the influencing factors of prevention and treatment of chronic pain in breast cancer survivors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Professional practice guidelines (PPGs) are intended to promote a high level of professional practice and serve as an educational resource, providing pragmatic guidance in a clinical area for psychologists. Measurement-based care (MBC) is an evidence-based psychological practice with accumulating empirical support and alignment with patient-centered care. In connection with the American Psychological Association’s Advisory Committee for Measurement-based Care and the Mental and Behavioral Health Registry, this article outlines various lines of support for the development and implementation of an MBC PPG. In addition to research evidence, we address the demonstrated need of this guideline across three domains: public benefit, professional guidance, and legal and regulatory issues. Consistent with the aspirational spirit of a PPG, this article proposes a draft PPG statement and highlights how an MBC PPG would improve service delivery, facilitate implementation of an evidence-based practice associated with symptom reduction, improved retention, and greater patient satisfaction, as well as create a framework that will better align changes in reimbursement models with patients’ and providers’ treatment goals. We also identify key future directions and critical gaps in MBC science and implementation that require attention © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Dutch initiatives targeting shared decision-making (SDM) are still growing, supported by the government, the Federation of Patients’ Organisations, professional bodies and healthcare insurers. The large majority of patients prefers the SDM model. The Dutch are working hard to realise improvement in the application of SDM in daily clinical practice, resulting in glimpses of success with objectified improvement on observed behavior. Nevertheless, the culture shift is still ongoing. Large-scale uptake of SDM behavior is still a challenge. We haven't yet fully reached the patients’ needs, given disappointing research data on patients’ experiences and professional behavior. In all Dutch implementation projects, early adopters, believers or higher-educated persons have been overrepresented, while patients with limited health literacy have been underrepresented. This is a huge problem as 25% of the Dutch adult population have limited health literacy. To further enhance SDM there are issues to be addressed: We need to make physicians conscious about their limited application of SDM in daily practice, especially regarding preference and decision talk. We need to reward clinicians for the extra work that comes with SDM. We need to be inclusive to patients with limited health literacy, who are less often actually involved in decision-making and at the same time more likely to regret their chosen treatment compared to patients with higher health literacy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Importance: Primary care panel size plays an increasing role in measuring primary care provider (ie, physicians and advanced practice providers, which include nurse practitioners and physician assistants) workload, setting practice capacity, and determining pay and can influence quality of care, access, and burnout. However, reported panel sizes vary widely. Objective: To identify how panels are defined, the degree of variation in these definitions, the consequences of different definitions of panel size, and research on strengths of different approaches. Evidence Review: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and Dissertations and Theses Global databases were searched from inception to April 28, 2021, for subject headings and text words to capture concepts of primary care panel size. Article review and data abstraction were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Main outcomes reported included rules for adding or removing patients from panels, rules for measuring primary care provider resources, consequences of different rules on reported panel size, and research on advantages and disadvantages of different rules. Findings: The literature search yielded 1687 articles, with 294 potentially relevant articles and 74 containing relevant data. Specific practices were identified from 29 health care systems and 5 empanelment implementation guides. Patients were most commonly empaneled after 1 primary care visit (24 of 34 [70.6%]), but some were empaneled only after several visits (5 [14.8%]), enrollment in a health plan (4 [11.8%]) or any visit to the health care system (1 [3.0%]). Patients were removed when no visit had occurred in a specified look-back period, which varied from 12 to 42 months. Regarding primary care provider resources, half of organizations assigned advanced practice providers independent panels and half had them share panels with a physician, increasing the physician's panel by 50% to 100%. Analyses demonstrated that changes in individual rules for adding patients, removing patients, or estimating primary care provider resources could increase reported panel size from 20% to 100%, without change in actual primary care provider workload. No research was found investigating advantages of different definitions. Conclusions and Relevance: Much variation exists in how panels are defined, and this variation can have substantial consequences on reported panel size. Research is needed on how to define primary care panels to best identify active patients, which could contribute to a widely accepted standard approach to panel definition. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Typical measures of maternity performance remain focused on the technical elements of birth, especially pathological elements, with insufficient measurement of nontechnical measures and those collected pre- and postpartum. New technologies allow for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) to be collected from large samples at multiple time points, which can be considered alongside existing administrative sources; however, such models are not widely implemented or evaluated. Since 2018, a longitudinal, personalized, and integrated user-reported data collection process for the maternal care pathway has been used in Tuscany, Italy. This model has been through two methodological iterations. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare and contrast two sampling models of longitudinal user-reported data for the maternity care pathway, exploring factors influencing participation, cost, and suitability of the models for different stakeholders. Methods: Data were collected by two modes: (1) "cohort" recruitment at the birth hospital of a predetermined sample size and (2) continuous, ongoing "census" recruitment of women at the first midwife appointment. Surveys were used to collect experiential and outcome data related to existing services. Women were included who passed 12 months after initial enrollment, meaning that they either received the surveys issued after that interval or dropped out in the intervening period. Data were collected from women in Tuscany, Italy, between September 2018 and July 2020. The total sample included 7784 individuals with 38,656 observations. The two models of longitudinal collection of user-reported data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, survival analysis, cost comparison, and a qualitative review. Results: Cohort sampling provided lower initial participation than census sampling, although very high subsequent response rates (87%) were obtained 1 year after enrollment. Census sampling had higher initial participation, but greater dropout (up to 45% at 1 year). Both models showed high response rates for online surveys. There were nonproportional dropout hazards over time. There were higher rates of dropout for women with foreign nationality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.88, P<.001), and lower rates of dropout for those who had a higher level of education (HR 0.77 and 0.61 for women completing high school and college, respectively; P<.001), were employed (HR 0.87, P=.01), in a relationship (HR 0.84, P=.04), and with previous pregnancies (HR 0.86, P=.002). The census model was initially more expensive, albeit with lower repeat costs and could become cheaper if repeated more than six times. Conclusions: The digital collection of user-reported data enables high response rates to targeted surveys in the maternity care pathway. The point at which pregnant women or mothers are recruited is relevant for response rates and sample bias. The census model of continuous enrollment and real-time data availability offers a wider set of potential benefits, but at an initially higher cost and with the requirement for more substantial data translation and managerial capacity to make use of such data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Setting: Nonoptimized medication therapies (NOMTs) are associated with likely avoidable illnesses and mortality affecting millions of people and costing an estimated $528 billion per year in excess health spending in the United States. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought into focus barriers limiting the ability of U.S. pharmacists and pharmacies to provide services that can reduce NOMTs and improve U.S. population health. Objectives: This National Science Foundation Center for Health Organization Transformation study explored potential strategies that U.S. pharmacists, pharmacies, and their partners could implement to reduce NOMTs while also delivering other forms of value to U.S. populations from 2021 to 2025 (during and after the COVID-19 pandemic). Design: A panel of senior leaders representing the U.S. pharmacist and pharmacy sector participated in a 4-round Delphi process to identify unmet needs, barriers, change drivers, and priority strategies for meeting those needs. Data were gathered and analyzed by public health researchers, most of whom are outside the pharmacist and pharmacy sector. Results: A comprehensive set of evidence-based strategies with potential to reduce NOMTs, protect and improve population health and well-being, and strengthen the sector were identified. Four transformational strategies were recommended: comprehensive payment and practice transformation, strengthening pharmacy data interoperability infrastructure, development of unifying measurement and management mechanisms, and development of a more robust national research infrastructure. Strengthening health equity was a cross-cutting strategy affecting all areas. Conclusion: The results may be of interest to policy makers, pharmacists, pharmacies, physicians, nurses and other clinicians, pharmaceutical firms, plan sponsors, plans, health systems, clinics, aging care, digital technology companies, and others interested in optimizing outcomes from medications and related therapies for U.S. populations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An important innovation in healthcare is the value-based healthcare (VBHC) framework, a way to solve health services' sustainability problems and ensure continuous improvement of healthcare quality. The Quality and Safety Unit at the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre has been since May 2018 coordinating the implementation of several healthcare innovation projects within the paradigm of VBHC. Implementing innovations in a complex institution, such as a tertiary hospital, is a challenge; we present here the lessons learned in the last 4 years of work. We detail exclusively the aspects related to continuous improvement and value addition to the process. In summary, for any VBHC project implementation, we found that there are five main issues: (1) adequate data quality; (2) development of data recording and visualization tools; (3) minimizing healthcare professional's effort to record data; (4) centralize governance, coordination, and transparency policies; (5) managerial's implication and follow-up. We described six steps key to ensure a successful implementation which are the following: testing the feasibility and complexities of the entry process; establishing leadership and coordination of the project; developing patient-reported outcomes and experience measurements; developing and adapting the data recording and data analysis tools; piloting in one or more medical conditions and evaluating the results and project management. The implementation duration can vary depending on the complexity of the Medical Condition Clinical Process and Patient Pathways. However, we estimate that the implementing phase will last a minimum of 18 and a maximum of 24 months. During this period, the institution should be capable of designing and implementing the proposed innovations. The implementation costs vary as well depending on the complexity, ranging from 90,000 euros to 250,000 euros. Implementation problems included the resistance to change of institutions and professionals. To date, there are few successful, published implementations of value-based healthcare. Our quality of care and patient safety methodological approach to the implementation has provided a particular advantage. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Healthcare systems increasingly move toward “value-based healthcare” (VBHC), aiming to further improve quality and performance of care as well as the sustainable use of resources. Evidence about healthcare professionals' contributions to VBHC, experienced job demands and resources as well as employee well-being in VBHC is scattered. This systematic review synthesizes this evidence by exploring how VBHC relates to the healthcare professional, and vice versa. Method: Seven databases were systematically searched for relevant studies. The search yielded 3,782 records, of which 45 were eligible for inclusion based on a two-step screening process using exclusion criteria performed by two authors independently. The quality of the included studies was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Based on inductive thematic analysis, the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model was modified. Subsequently, this modified model was applied deductively for a second round of thematic analysis. Results: Ten behaviors of healthcare professionals to enhance value in care were identified. These behaviors and associated changes in professionals' work content and work environment impacted the experienced job demands and resources and, in turn, employee well-being and job strain. This review revealed 16 constructs as job demand and/or job resource. Examples of these include role strain, workload and meaning in work. Four constructs related to employee well-being, including engagement and job satisfaction, and five constructs related to job strain, including exhaustion and concerns, were identified. A distinction was made between job demands and resources that were a pure characteristic of VBHC, and job demands and resources that resulted from environmental factors such as how care organizations shaped VBHC. Conclusion and Discussion: This review shows that professionals experience substantial job demands and resources resulting from the move toward VBHC and their active role therein. Several job demands are triggered by an unsupportive organizational environment. Hence, increased organizational support may contribute to mitigating or avoiding adverse psychosocial factors and enhance positive psychosocial factors in a VBHC context. Further research to estimate the effects of VBHC on healthcare professionals is warranted. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Complex rehabilitation technologies (CRT) support independence for individuals with disabilities by enabling mobility for function, employment, education, and independent living. CRT service delivery is evolving, with changes to funding, provider qualifications, consumer needs, and technological advances. This scoping review investigated service delivery processes for individuals with disabilities who have a mobility impairment, while specifically identifying best practices, barriers, and unique features of health delivery policies and practices. Methods: We used a framework described by Colquhoun et. al. for conducting scoping reviews, a six-step process that includes: 1) identifying the research question, 2) identifying studies, 3) selecting studies 4) data charting, 5) reporting results and 6) consultation. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was also used for reporting results of the review. Results: Common categories were identified and organised into a hierarchical structure of four categories and 16 sub-categories. The primary categories included “policy”, “consumer”, “service delivery”, and “wheeled mobility devices”. The sub-categories described funding sources, consumer and professional populations, service delivery guidelines, and types of mobility devices. Analysis indicated the data were from 21 countries and 14 combinations of funding sources, and the articles were primarily descriptive studies. Conclusion: This scoping review identified evidence from various countries, health systems, and stakeholder. Currently, this process does not proactively address the needs of individuals with mobility disabilities. The scoping review provides the foundation for the development of a novel policy on the provision of CRT services and devices to address these needs.Implications for Rehabilitation Examination of national and international service delivery practices in diverse clinical and funding environments indicate various challenges and opportunities for improvement. CRT consumers are negatively impacted by current service delivery practices, including long wait times, lack of specialised clinical expertise, and limited consumer education opportunities. More consistent and widespread research is needed within the CRT provision industry to grow evidence-based practice related to complex rehabilitation technology and individuals with disabilities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Fourth Industrial Revolution may help many sectors and industries, whereas healthcare will be significantly impacted. Medical advances will be swifter, better and more effective, quickly providing medications to patients. It will act as a leveller for healthcare services by making them available to everybody. Medical 4.0 is the fourth medical revolution, employing emerging technologies to create significant advancements in healthcare. New medical 4.0 technology has advanced significantly, ranging from mobile computing to cloud computing, over the previous decade and is now ready to be employed as commercially accessible, networked systems. Expanding and with higher life expectancies, there is an enormous need for improved healthcare for older populations. This paper explores Medical 4.0 and its demand in the healthcare sector and discusses various progressive steps for Medical 4.0 implementation. Smart and Advanced Features of Medical 4.0 Practices are discussed diagrammatically. Medical 4.0 envisions a strongly interconnected health system. A hospital bed can be connected to the network and use patient data via the Internet of Things (IoT). Finally, this paper explores & provides the significant applications of Medical 4.0 for healthcare services. In addition to being creative, Medical 4.0 decreases the healthcare burden in affluent nations and offers good services to less developed countries, providing comprehensive and high-quality treatment. Medical 4.0 is characterised by technical discoveries and developments in the medical profession to encourage patient-centred therapy and drugs. This digital transformation, where patients' data will be electronically collected and utilised by technology to better understand and diagnose them, replaces the doctor-centric treatment techniques with a patient-centric paradigm. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: School based asthma care is being increasingly used to combat uncontrolled pediatric asthma. Objective: The purpose of these secondary analyses was to explore multi-level perspectives regarding school-based asthma medical management for inner city, school-aged children with poor asthma control. Methods: Sixty-six participants from two large U.S. urban school districts and key stakeholders participated in 1:1 interviews and focus groups. Participants were selected from across the asthma care community (children/caregivers, school personnel, nurses, pharmacists, healthcare providers, and administrators/insurers). Qualitative and descriptive techniques were used to analyze data. Results: Goals: Children/caregivers prioritized living a normal active life with few asthma worries. Other stakeholders prioritized reducing student’s asthma related emergency room visits and lost learning time. Facilitators: Continuity of care, strong relationships between care community members, and incentivizers were commonly suggested facilitators. School-based asthma management was viewed as a strong facilitator, particularly in the presence of a full-time school nurse. Barriers: Four themes were identified. (1) Greater systems and policy support for asthma management is needed in general, and at school in particular. (2) Overburdened families and systems often operate in crisis-mode, and asthma management is often not a priority until crisis is reached. (3) Discordance and distrust between members of the asthma care community can hinder shared asthma management. (4) Better communication is needed at all levels to improve care. Conclusion: Moving away from a crisis-based approach to asthma management for high-risk children will require increased systemic support for proactive asthma care and optimized communication within the asthma care community.

AB  - Process mining applies robust methodologies using data mining and machine learning for pattern recognition, using models that represent the process flow identified by the sequence of events, their timing, and the assessment of resources used. To evaluate the use of process mining in health care, with emphasis on the identification of characteristics, health care studies were selected based on a systematic review of the literature, well-defined eligibility criteria, and guided research questions. Such questions address the strategy and algorithm adopted, the location used, and the main contributions for the identified application. A total of 270 articles were selected. Among the identified applications, the discovery of process models was the most frequent, followed by resource analysis and evaluation. The most adopted algorithms were identified, the Fuzzy Miner and Heuristic Miner. One may highlight, among the main contributions, the analysis and discovery of process models for the evaluation of patient care and the evaluation of process conformity, focused on medical protocols and clinical guidelines. This review highlighted the significant use of process models discovery in their evaluation, thus supporting the proposal of changing the health care model so that it favors resources evaluation and care quality. There is also an important challenge regarding the use of such technique; on the one hand, concerning data integration and a more automatic recognition of standards and, on the other hand, concerning the application of standards focused on needs for compliance evaluation between discovered models, medical protocols and clinical guidelines. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Three key challenges to a whole-system approach to process improvement in health systems are the complexity of socio-technical activity, the capacity to change purposefully, and the consequent capacity to proactively manage and govern the system. The literature on healthcare improvement demonstrates the persistence of these problems. In this project, the Access-Risk-Knowledge (ARK) Platform, which supports the implementation of improvement projects, was deployed across three healthcare organisations to address risk management for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). In each organisation, quality and safety experts initiated an ARK project and participated in a follow-up survey and focus group. The platform was then evaluated against a set of fifteen needs related to complex system transformation. While the results highlighted concerns about the platform’s usability, feedback was generally positive regarding its effectiveness and potential value in supporting HCAI risk management. The ARK Platform addresses the majority of identified needs for system transformation; other needs were validated in the trial or are undergoing development. This trial provided a starting point for a knowledge-based solution to enhance organisational governance and develop shared knowledge through a Community of Practice that will contribute to sustaining and generalising that change. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Early hospital readmissions remain common in patients with conditions targeted by the CMS Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP). There is still no consensus on whether readmission measures should be adjusted based on social factors, and there are few population studies within the U.S. examining how social characteristics influence readmissions for HRRP-targeted conditions. The objective of this study was to determine if specific socio-demographic and -economic factors are associated with 30-day readmissions in HRRP-targeted conditions: acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Methods: The Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to identify patients admitted with HRRP-targeted conditions between January 1, 2010 and September 30, 2015. Stroke was included as a control condition because it is not included in the HRRP. Multivariate models were used to assess the relationship between three social and economic characteristics (gender, urban/rural hospital designation, and estimated median household income within the patient’s zip code) and 30-day readmission rates using a hierarchical two-level logistic model. Age-adjusted models were used to assess relationship differences between Medicare vs. non-Medicare populations. Results: There were 19,253,997 weighted index hospital admissions for all diagnoses and 3,613,488 30-day readmissions between 2010 and 2015. Patients in the lowest income quartile (≤$37,999) had an increased odds of 30-day readmission across all conditions (P < 0.0001). Female gender and rural hospital designation were associated with a decreased odds of 30-day readmission for most targeted conditions (P < 0.05). Similar findings were also seen in patients ≥65 years old. Conclusions: Socio-demographic and -economic factors are associated with 30-day readmission rates and should be incorporated into tools or interventions to improve discharge planning and mitigate against readmission. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: As a discipline, health organisation and management is focused on health-specific, collective behaviours and activities, whose empirical and theoretical scholarship remains under-utilised in the field of implementation science. This under-engagement between fields potentially constrains the understanding of mechanisms influencing the implementation of evidence-based innovations in health care. The aim of this viewpoint article is to examine how a selection of theories, models and frameworks (theoretical approaches) have been applied to better understand phenomena at the micro, meso and macro systems levels for the implementation of health care innovations. The purpose of which is to illustrate the potential applicability and complementarity of embedding health organisation and management scholarship within the study of implementation science. Design/methodology/approach: The authors begin by introducing the two fields, before exploring how exemplary theories, models and frameworks have been applied to study the implementation of innovations in the health organisation and management literature. In this viewpoint article, the authors briefly reviewed a targeted collection of articles published in the Journal of Health Organization and Management (as a proxy for the broader literature) and identified the theories, models and frameworks they applied in implementation studies. The authors then present a more detailed exploration of three interdisciplinary theories and how they were applied across three different levels of health systems: normalization process theory (NPT) at the micro individual and interpersonal level; institutional logics at the meso organisational level; and complexity theory at the macro policy level. These examples are used to illustrate practical considerations when implementing change in health care organisations that can and have been used across various levels of the health system beyond these presented examples. Findings: Within the Journal of Health Organization and Management, the authors identified 31 implementation articles, utilising 34 theories, models or frameworks published in the last five years. As an example of how theories, models and frameworks can be applied at the micro individual and interpersonal levels, behavioural theories originating from psychology and sociology (e.g. NPT) were used to guide the selection of appropriate implementation strategies or explain implementation outcomes based on identified barriers and enablers to implementing innovations of interest. Projects aiming to implement change at the meso organisational level can learn from the application of theories such as institutional logics, which help elucidate how relationships at the macro and micro-level have a powerful influence on successful or unsuccessful organisational action. At the macro policy level, complexity theory represented a promising direction for implementation science by considering health care organisations as complex adaptive systems. Originality/value: This paper illustrates the utility of a range of theories, models and frameworks for implementation science, from a health organisation and management standpoint. The authors’ viewpoint article suggests that increased crossovers could contribute to strengthening both disciplines and our understanding of how to support the implementation of evidence-based innovations in health care. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - We analyze the two recent Medicare alternative payment models, the comprehensive primary care plus (CPC+) and the primary care first (PCF). Both models comprise fee-for-service, traditional capitation, and pay-for-performance (P4P) components. The main objective of these reimbursement models is to advance toward value-based care. However, the models confer some hesitations since the P4P component is based on factors not entirely controlled by the practice, increasing the potential admission of healthier patients and affecting the profit of small primary care practices. We have modified the P4P component in both models to include a non-controllable agent (the hierarchical condition category score) and a controllable factor (the Bice–Boxerman continuity of care index) through a probabilistic classification model to predict hospital admissions. This study aims to determine the impact of adjusting the P4P component, in the CPC+ and PCF reimbursement models, on the profit per team, revenue for performance per team, and severity of admitted patients. We develop a mixed-integer programming formulation and analyze, using a 2k factorial design, the reimbursement models and the main elements of their adjusted P4P components (i.e., the probabilistic classification model coefficients and hospital admission threshold). The results indicate that the coefficients of the probabilistic classification model and the hospital admission threshold have a significant effect on the profit and revenue for performance per team. There is also a tendency of the PCF to admit less severe patients than the CPC+. Yet, the effects are more notable in the PCF payment model because the proportion of P4P in the total revenue under the CPC+ is minimal (16.5% versus <1%). Similarly, the PCF's downside is its sensitivity to P4P changes, displaying high variability in the output variables under analysis. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A funnel plot is a graphical method to evaluate health-care quality by comparing hospital performances on certain outcomes. So far, in nephrology, this method has been applied to clinical outcomes like mortality and complications. However, patient-reported outcomes (PROs; eg, health-related quality of life [HRQOL]) are becoming increasingly important and should be incorporated into this quality assessment. Using funnel plots has several advantages, including clearly visualized precision, detection of volume-effects, discouragement of ranking hospitals and easy interpretation of results. However, without sufficient knowledge of underlying methods, it is easy to stumble into pitfalls, such as overinterpretation of standardized scores, incorrect direct comparisons of hospitals and assuming a hospital to be in-control (ie, to perform as expected) based on underpowered comparisons. Furthermore, application of funnel plots to PROs is accompanied by additional challenges related to the multidimensional nature of PROs and difficulties with measuring PROs. Before using funnel plots for PROs, high and consistent response rates, adequate case mix correction and high-quality PRO measures are required. In this article, we aim to provide insight into the use and interpretation of funnel plots by presenting an overview of the basic principles, pitfalls and considerations when applied to PROs, using examples from Dutch routine dialysis care. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Public performance regimes are bedeviled by a paradox: they must engage the specialized knowledge of professionals who often perceive those very regimes as a threat to their autonomy. The authors use a mixed-method analysis of performance management in Danish hospitals, with separate data for managers and frontline professionals, to offer two insights into this challenge. First, the study shows that managerial behavior—in the form of performance information use—matters to the way frontline professionals engage in goal-based learning. Second, it shows that the way managers use performance data matters. When managers use data in ways that reinforce the perception of performance management as an externally imposed tool of control, professionals withdraw effort. However, when managers use data in ways that solve organizational problems, professionals engage in goal-based learning. The threat to professional values that performance regimes pose can therefore be mitigated by managers using data in ways that complements those values. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Models of Care (MoCs), and their local Models of Service Delivery, for people with musculoskeletal conditions are becoming an acceptable way of supporting effective implementation of value-based care. MoCs can support the quadruple aim of value-based care through providing people with musculoskeletal disease improved access to health services, better health outcomes and satisfactory experience of their healthcare; ensure the health professionals involved are experiencing satisfaction in delivering such care and health system resources are better utilised. Implementation of MoCs is relevant at the levels of clinical practice (micro), service delivery organisations (meso) and health system (macro) levels. The development, implementation and evaluation of MoCs has evolved over the last decade to more purposively engage people with lived experience of their condition, to operationalise the Chronic Care Model and to employ innovative solutions. This paper explores how MoCs have evolved and are supporting the delivery of value-based care in health systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives Previous studies on patient-centred care (PCC) and its facilitators and barriers usually considered specific patient groups, healthcare settings and aspects of PCC or focused on expert perspectives. The objective of this study was to analyse patients' perspectives of facilitators and barriers towards implementing PCC. Design We conducted semistructured individual interviews with chronically ill patients. The interviewees were encouraged to share positive and negative experiences of care and the related facilitators and barriers in all settings including preventive, acute and chronic health issues. Interview data were analysed based on the concept of content analysis. Setting Interviews took place at the University Hospital Cologne, nursing homes, at participants' homes or by telephone. Participants Any person with at least one chronic illness living in the region of Cologne was eligible for participation. 25 persons with an average age of 60 years participated in the interviews. The participants suffered from various chronic conditions including mental health problems, oncological, metabolic, neurological diseases, but also shared experiences related to acute health issues. Results Participants described facilitators and barriers of PCC on the microlevel (eg, patient-provider interaction), mesolevel (eg, health and social care organisation, HSCO) and macrolevel (eg, laws, financing). In addition to previous concepts, interviewees illustrated the importance of being an active patient by taking individual responsibility for health. Interviewees considered functioning teams and healthy staff members a facilitator of PCC as this can compensate stressful situations or lack of staff to some degree. A lack of transparency in financing and reimbursement was identified as barrier to PCC. Conclusion Individual providers and HSCOs can address many facilitators and barriers of PCC as perceived by patients. Large-scale changes such as reduction of administrative barriers, the expansion of care networks or higher mandatory nurse to patient ratios require political action and incentives.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the main determinants (criteria as well as sub-criteria) influencing the adoption decision of cloud computing (CC) in the healthcare sector. In the present study, qualitative interviews and the Delphi method are used to find the relevance of identified determinants (criteria and sub-criteria) from literature. Further, an integrated hybrid approach of interpretive structural modeling, analytic hierarchy process, and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (ISM-AHP-TOPSIS) have been employed to identify interrelationships among criteria, rank critical criteria as well as subcriteria, and find the most suitable cloud service provider (CSP) respectively. This study analyses seven criteria and twenty-one sub-criteria that offers a roadmap to decision-makers before CC-adoption (CCA). The analysis of ISM and AHP revealed technology as the most critical and human-environment as the least critical criteria. The vital sub-criteria associated with each criterion are Management Strategic Planning (under Organisation), Government Policy (External Environment), Security (Technology), Financing of IT in Hospital (Economic), Perceived Visibility (Social), and Attitude of Colleagues about Cloud Computing (Human Environment). The results from TOPSIS revealed CSP5 being the most suitable service provider followed by CSP2. Finally, this research makes methodological contribution in terms of an integrated hybrid method, to select a suitable CSP for the healthcare sector and the theoretical contribution in terms of criteria & sub-criteria. This article answers an important question, i.e., whether the benefits of CCA outweighs its barriers, thereby exploring the potential (and future) of CC for the advancement of healthcare provision. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Despite the evidence of benefits, clinical pharmacy services (CPS) are not uniformly implemented across healthcare institutions. Understanding the influencing factors and identifying the domains in which they act is the first step to a successful implementation. Objective: To identify the factors that affect the implementation of CPS for inpatients and to categorize them. Methods: Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, IPA, Medline/PubMed, and Lilacs databases were researched up until January 2018. The search strategy was developed using text words or MESH terms related to the following four domains: “clinical pharmacy,” “influencing factors,” “implementation,” and “hospital.” Two reviewers selected original research articles that reported the factors influencing the implementation of CPS in hospitals, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the studies. After framework synthesis and categorization of the factors, a diagrammatic approach was used to present the results. Results: Fifty-three factors were identified in the 21 studies that were included in this review. The most cited influencing factors were uniformly distributed across the following four domains: Attitudinal, POlitical, TEChnical and Administrative (APOTECA domains). However, in terms of level (pharmacist, healthcare team, patient, institution, and national organization), the “pharmacist” group had the highest concentration of factors. “Clinical skills and knowledge” was the most frequently cited implementation factor, followed by “time to implement CPS.” Conclusion: Our findings showed the multifactorial nature of CPS implementation process. We suggest that factors from all four APOTECA domains need to be fully considered and strategies need to be addressed for all five groups of interest to successfully implement CPS in hospitals. Future studies on the influence of implementation stages, interrelationships of implementing factors, and strategies to overcome barriers could accelerate the successful adoption of these services.

AB  - Purpose of Review: In recent years, the recommendation for and use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in routine diabetes care has significantly increased. We review recent evidence and highlight key opportunities and challenges related to the active clinical use of PROMs to support person-centered diabetes care and focus areas for future research in the area. Recent Findings: Recent pragmatic studies support that integration of multi-dimensional PROMs for diabetes in clinical care as part of a care improvement strategy can be acceptable for and valued by people with diabetes (PWD) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) and may improve multiple aspects of quality of care, including screening, medical care monitoring and decision support, individualization of self-management support and goal-setting, and broader benefits related to active patient participation and person-centred diabetes care. We identify multiple intervention, individual, and care setting characteristics, which influence acceptability, feasibility, implementation, and effectiveness of PROMs in routine care. Recent clinical PROM studies highlight the value of mixed methods research and systematic involvement of PWD, clinicians, and other stakeholders in the design and implementation of questionnaires for patient input in routine diabetes care. Summary: We identified a new significant trend towards participatory development of multi-dimensional PROMs with the aim of IT-enabled integration into routine diabetes care to facilitate multiple components of person-centered diabetes care and better clinical, quality of life, and cost outcomes. While results from large-scale randomized controlled studies are still limited, a growing number of pragmatic implementation studies support that user-centric PROM interventions have the potential to facilitate significant improvements in care for PWD. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Health and social care systems are under pressure to organise care around patients' needs with constrained resources. Several studies reveal that care is constantly challenged by balancing economic requirements against individual patients' preferences and needs. Therefore, value-based health and social care aims to facilitate patient-centredness while taking the resources spent into consideration. The OrgValue project examines the implementation of patient-centredness while considering the health and social care organisations' resource orientation in the model region of the city of Cologne, Germany. Methods and analysis First, the implementation status of patient-centredness as well as its facilitators and barriers - also in terms of resource orientation - will be assessed through face-to-face interviews with decision-makers (at least n=18) from health and social care organisations (HSCOs) in Cologne. Second, patients' understanding of patient-centredness and their preferences and needs will be revealed by conducting face-to-face interviews (at least n=15). Third, the qualitative results will provide the basis for a quantitative survey of decision-makers from all HSCOs in Cologne, which will include questions on patient-centredness, resource orientation and determinants of implementation. Fourth, qualitative interviews with decision-makers from different types of HSCOs will be conducted to develop a uniform measurement instrument on the cost and service structure of HSCOs. Ethics and dissemination For all collected data, the relevant data protection regulations will be adhered to. Consultation and a positive vote from the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne have been obtained. All personal identifiers (eg, name, date of birth) will be pseudonymised. Dissemination strategies include a feedback report as well as research and development workshops for the organisations with the aim of initiating organisational learning and organisational development, presenting results in publications and at conferences, and public relations.

AB  - Background: Disparity-reduction programs have been shown to vary in the degree to which they achieve their goal; yet the causes of these variations is rarely studied. We investigated a broad-scale program in Israel's largest health plan, aimed at reducing disparities in socially disadvantaged groups using a composite measure of seven health and health care indicators. Methods: A realistic evaluation was conducted to evaluate the program in 26 clinics and their associated managerial levels. First, we performed interviews with key stakeholders and an ethnographic observation of a regional meeting to derive the underlying program theory. Next, semi-structured interviews with 109 clinic teams, subregional headquarters, and regional headquarters personnel were conducted. Social network analysis was performed to derive measures of team interrelations. Perceived team effectiveness (TE) and clinic characteristics were assessed to elicit contextual characteristics. Interventions implemented by clinics were identified from interviews and coded according to the mechanisms each clinic employed. Assessment of each clinic's performance on the seven-indicator composite measure was conducted at baseline and after 3 years. Finally, we reviewed different context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations to understand what works to reduce disparity, and under what circumstances. Results: Clinics' inner contextual characteristics varied in both network density and perceived TE. Successful CMO configurations included 1) highly dense clinic teams having high perceived TE, only a small gap to minimize, and employing a wide range of interventions; (2) clinics with a large gap to minimize with high clinic density and high perceived TE, focusing efforts on tailoring services to their enrollees; and (3) clinics having medium to low density and perceived TE, and strong middle-management support. Conclusions: Clinics that achieved disparity reduction had high clinic density, close ties with middle management, and tailored interventions to the unique needs of the populations they serve. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Numerous studies and trials are conducted under the evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine (EBCAM) paradigm. Some individuals view the results generated by this approach as symbolic evidential proof of complementary medicine, and as representative of practice. Such evaluations are made even though the ability to capture and reflect clinical reality by the methods used is questioned. The effect of this type of research on complementary medicine researchers and practitioners has received minimal consideration, and this article explores this subject by critically reviewing the literature and theorizing the effects on the lifeworld and values of those embodied by EBCAM. Methods: This review accesses the discourse of various disciplines involved with, and commenting on, complementary medicine research. Collected literature is collated within specified limits, subjected to argumentation analysis, and synthesized within a critical theory methodology. Emergent themes are examined, and the effects of EBCAM on holistic researcher and practitioner lifeworld and values are theorized via the colonization framework of critical social theorist Jürgen Habermas. Results: The use of an evidence-based medicine research model to investigate complementary medicine practice is not well regarded by those who critically examine its use. Within a critical theory framework, the generation and application of research resulting from EBCAM is viewed as a philosophically incongruent process arising from a dominative discourse that can colonize lifeworld. This can result in a variety of pathological symptoms that may have a detrimental effect. Conclusions: The application of EBCAM has the theoretical potential to damage complementary medicine culture, profession, and practice. Its ongoing use requires thought, attention, and careful revision, taking into account the lifeworld and values of researchers and practitioners. If this inclusive view can occur, knowledge generation with relevance to the whole of the professions could proceed. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.
